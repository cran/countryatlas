# countryatlas 3.0.0

The whole of the roadmap tracked in
[#19](https://github.com/PursuitOfDataScience/countryatlas/issues/19), in one
release. 46 new exports and two new datasets take the package from "join World
Bank data to a map" to "join *anyone's* data, to the map as it was in 1950, and
say honestly what the picture does and does not support".

The version is 3.0.0 rather than 2.1.0 because three things change behaviour for
existing code: `world_map(projection = "mercator")` now produces a different
(and usable) map, `morans_i()` returns two more columns, and
`geom_country_labels()` takes `data` as its second argument. Details under
**Breaking changes**.

## Breaking changes

* **`geom_country_labels()` gains `data` as its second argument**, matching the
  `geom_*(mapping, data, ...)` convention every other ggplot2 geom follows. A
  call that passed `repel` positionally -- `geom_country_labels(aes(...),
  FALSE)` -- now binds that `FALSE` to `data` and must name it. Named calls are
  unaffected.
* **`morans_i()` returns `n_excluded` and `excluded`.** Code that assumed a
  five-column result will see seven. The statistic itself is unchanged.
* **`world_map(projection = "mercator")` draws a different map** -- see the bug
  fix below. It was previously unusable, so this is a fix rather than a
  regression, but the output does change.
* **`style = "binned"` draws different bins** in `world_map()`, `globe_map()`
  and `value_by_alpha_map()`. `n_bins` was silently ignored there (see the bug
  fix below), so the bin count and boundaries change for any existing call.
  `style = "quantile"` and `"jenks"` are unaffected.
* **`classification_report = TRUE` returns `NULL` for `style = "continuous"`**
  instead of a row-per-distinct-value table, and warns. Code that read the
  attribute after a continuous map got a table that described nothing; it now
  gets nothing, explicitly.
* `world_map()`'s new arguments were deliberately appended *after* `recenter`,
  so no existing positional call to it changes meaning.
* **`country_join()` and `country_join_all()` gain `warn`, defaulting to
  `TRUE`.** They now warn about country names that resolve to nothing, so code
  that joins on messy names will start emitting a warning it did not before.
  The join result is unchanged; pass `warn = FALSE` for the old silence.
* **`world_map(engine = "tmap")` failed opaquely on an older tmap.** The
  engine builds its scales with `tm_scale_intervals()`,
  `tm_scale_continuous()` and `tm_scale_categorical()` -- the tmap 4 API. tmap
  3 configured scales through arguments on `tm_polygons()` and exports none of
  them, and because `DESCRIPTION` pins no version on any `Suggests` package,
  the `need_pkg("tmap")` gate was satisfied by any tmap at all. An older
  install then died on R's own "'tm_scale_intervals' is not an exported object
  from 'namespace:tmap'", which names neither the cause nor the cure. The
  engine now checks for the constructors it needs and says so, pointing at
  either an upgrade or `engine = "ggplot2"`. The check is on the capability
  rather than a version number, as `as_ggsql_source()` already does for
  duckdb's `shared_home`: that is the thing actually required, and it stays
  correct whichever release introduced it.
* **`locate_country()` measured its snap-back distance from the wrong point.**
  A point falling just outside the coarse coastline is snapped to the nearest
  country when it is within `tolerance_km`, and that step paired points with
  countries using `st_nearest_points(..., by_element = TRUE)`. The argument is
  `pairwise`; `by_element` is not a formal of it, so sf absorbed the name into
  `...` and ignored it, returning the full *n*×*n* cross product instead of
  *n* pairs -- after which each unmatched point was measured against a
  different point's country. Cuba's centroid sits 10.8 km off the 110m
  coastline and should snap; in a 17-point call it was measured against
  American Samoa's point, came out at 10167 km, and was dropped to `NA`. One
  unmatched point was safe, because 1x1 is the same thing as pairwise -- which
  is why every single-point example was correct and only multi-point calls
  were wrong. The error ran both ways: a bogus distance landing under the
  tolerance would have attributed a point to a country it is not in. Fixed,
  with a length check so it cannot silently regress to a cross product again.
* **`spatial_lag()` did not say which countries its weights excluded.** A
  country with no neighbour gets `NA`, which the documentation states -- but
  that `NA` is indistinguishable from one caused by a missing input value, and
  nothing in the result said which countries the weights had dropped.
  `morans_i()` and `gearys_c()` answer this by returning `excluded`;
  `getis_ord()` and `local_morans()` omit the row, so a `setdiff()` recovers
  it. `spatial_lag()` returns the caller's frame, so it now attaches the codes
  as the `"countryatlas_excluded"` attribute -- the same channel this package
  already uses for `"countryatlas_cartogram"` and `"countryatlas_clubs"`. Not
  a warning: on real geography some country always lacks a land neighbour, so
  a warning would fire on every ordinary call. On a panel the attribute holds
  the union across years, since the weights are geography rather than time.
* **`neighbors()` could not tell a typo from an island.** An unresolved name
  becomes `NA`, and the `%in%` filter simply never matches it, so a
  misspelling returned no rows -- indistinguishable from a country that
  genuinely has no land border. The function's own example makes that
  collision explicit ("Japan has no land border"). `distance_between()` and
  `convert_country()` take the same input and both report an unresolved value;
  `neighbors()` now does too, and gains `warn = TRUE`. Iceland still returns
  zero rows in silence, because that zero is real.
* **`country_timeline()` said nothing about a name it could not resolve.** An
  unrecognised input came back as a row of `NA`, which reads as a country with
  no recorded history rather than a name nobody matched -- in a package whose
  whole premise is that unmatched names are the problem worth reporting.
  `dissolve_country()` takes the same input shape and has warned about exactly
  this since 1.0.0. `country_timeline()` now gives the same warning, with the
  same `check_country_match()` pointer, and gains `warn = TRUE` to match its
  sibling. A historical name is still silent: `"USSR"` is *meant* to fail the
  ISO lookup and be resolved by the historical spine, which is why that
  lookup's own warning stays suppressed.
* **Three panel verbs did nothing, silently, on a cross-section.** Handed one
  year per country, `growth_rate()`, `lag_by_country()` and `diff_by_country()`
  each added a column that was `NA` in every row and said nothing -- the verb
  accomplished literally nothing, and the result read as a computation that had
  run. They now report it (`countryatlas_all_na_result`), stating what the verb
  needs ("a lag of 3 needs 4 years for the same country") and pointing at
  `complete_years()`. The notice fires only when the whole column is `NA` and
  the source column had data, so the ordinary panel case -- where just the
  first year per country is `NA` -- stays silent.
* **`country_network()` validated `top_n` after building the network.** It was
  the one verb here that did its whole job and then rejected an argument it
  could have rejected at the door. `top_n` only trims the finished edge list,
  so the check is now made first.
* **`share_of_world()` returned a column of `NA` without saying why.** A zero
  or non-finite total is a dead end -- the division would give `NaN` or `Inf`
  -- and the guard that turns it into `NA` was right. Its silence was not:
  `per_capita()` and `to_ppp()` both report an unusable denominator, under the
  same two condition classes, while this one returned nothing but `NA` and
  read as "these countries have no share" rather than "there was no total to
  take a share of". It now reports it, naming the years affected on a panel
  (only the bad years go `NA`; the rest keep their shares).
* **`world_map(engine = "tmap")` now projects.** It took `projection` and
  `recenter` and drew in the frame's own CRS regardless (see the bug fix
  below), so every existing tmap map changes: the default is Equal Earth, as
  it already was on the ggplot2 engine. A bad projection name is now an error
  there rather than being ignored.
* **Five verbs now return a tibble rather than the class they were handed.**
  `to_ppp()`, `smooth_rates()`, `interpolate_missing()`, `spatial_lag()` and
  `rank_countries()` returned whatever arrived: a `data.frame` stayed a
  `data.frame`, and a grouped frame stayed grouped (see the bug fixes below).
  They now normalise, as their sibling verbs always did. Code that relied on
  `df[, "col"]` dropping to a vector, or on an inherited grouping surviving
  the call, changes.
* **`complete_years()` returns an `sf` frame when given one.** It previously
  dropped the class while leaving the geometry column in place, so a pipeline
  that repaired the result with `st_as_sf()` is now re-wrapping something that
  is already `sf` -- harmless, but no longer necessary.
* **A duplicated column name is now refused.** `per_capita()` and `to_ppp()`
  accepted a frame with two `gdp` columns and silently computed from the
  first; ten other verbs failed with a message about internals in tibble. All
  of them now reject it up front (see the bug fix below).
* **`region` is applied when `geometry = "none"`.** `world_data()` and
  `join_world()` ignored it on that branch and returned every country in the
  world (see the bug fix below), so a call passing both now gets fewer rows --
  the ones it asked for. A bounding box, having nothing to clip against, is
  refused rather than silently dropped.
* **Several backends now warn where they used to accept an argument and drop
  it** -- `scale` and `projection` on the polygon backend, the ggplot2-only
  arguments on the `tmap` and `mapgl` renderers, `title`/`subtitle` on
  `world_table(engine = "tibble")`, and `...` on two of `interactive_map()`'s
  engines. The drawings are unchanged; only the silence is. Code running under
  `options(warn = 2)` will now stop where it previously carried on.
* **Argument values are no longer partially matched.** Every exported function
  that takes a fixed set of choices now validates with `rlang::arg_match()`
  instead of `match.arg()`, so `style = "quant"` errors rather than resolving to
  `"quantile"`. The error names the argument, the function and the valid
  choices, and suggests the one you meant -- `match.arg()` reported only
  `'arg' should be one of ...`, naming neither. Spelled-out values are
  unaffected.

* **`world_tiles` places 171 of its 239 countries in a different cell.** The
  `break` in the placement scan left only its inner loop, so a country whose own
  cell was taken was re-placed at the *last* free cell in the search square
  rather than the first -- and every cell claimed along the way stayed marked
  occupied for nobody. That wasted 129 of 368 cells and pushed later countries
  further out still: mean displacement from a country's true position was 1.9
  cells with a worst case of 7.1, against 0.9 and 2.8 now. `tile_map()`
  layouts change accordingly. The grid is still 40x24 and still has one
  country per cell.
* **`dispute_policy()` returns the policy it replaced, not the one you set.**
  R's convention for a setter -- `options()`, `par()`, `sf::sf_use_s2()` -- so
  `on.exit(dispute_policy(dispute_policy("neutral")))` now restores the old
  value, where before it was a no-op. Reading the current policy with no
  argument is unchanged.
* **`world_geometry("coastline")` and `world_geometry("ocean")` name their
  geometry column `geometry`.** It was `x`, from `st_as_sf()` on a bare `sfc`,
  making these the only two `what` values whose column was not called what the
  return contract says. Code that referred to `$x` must change; code written
  against the other four now works on all six.
* **`gini()` and `theil()` warn instead of returning a bare `NA`** when the
  input is empty, or when `na.rm = FALSE` and values are missing. The value is
  unchanged; code running under `options(warn = 2)` will now stop where it
  previously carried an unexplained `NA` forward.

## Bug fixes

* **`globe_map()` built globes it could not draw.** On the default `sf`
  backend, 63 of 216 sampled viewpoints (29%) failed when the plot was
  printed, with grid's "Invalid graphics path": a country on the horizon lost
  its far-side vertices in the orthographic transform and kept whatever was
  left (at lon 120, lat 20 Chad became a single point). The plot object built
  fine, so nothing noticed until it was drawn, and a 60-frame
  `spin_globe(backend = "sf")` could not get through one rotation. The
  viewpoints that did draw closed every horizon country with a straight chord.
  Geometry is now cut at the horizon on the sphere before it is projected, in
  `globe_map()`, `world_map(projection = "orthographic")` on either engine,
  `world_geometry()`, `projection_compare()` and `tissot_map()`, CShapes'
  historical borders included; every sampled viewpoint draws,
  and the colour scale and coverage are the same from every side.
* **`world_map(na_style = "hatched")` built maps it could not draw where `sf`
  does not load.** `ggpattern` draws the stripes through `gridpattern`, which
  clips them with `sf` when the plot is printed. `sf` is always installed
  alongside, but where its system libraries (udunits, GDAL, GEOS, PROJ) are
  missing from the library path it cannot be loaded, so the map built fine and
  then failed on print with "unable to load shared object units.so". Hatching
  now checks that `sf` loads and otherwise falls back to grey with a message,
  as it already did when `ggpattern` is absent.
* **`world_map(na_style = "hatched")` took half a minute to print on the
  polygon backend.** `ggpattern` clipped a fresh set of stripes to every
  polygon, and the no-data countries of a world map are many polygons (169
  for `co2_per_capita` in `world_snapshot`, most of them islands, plus
  Antarctica). The stripes are now clipped once, to all of them together:
  the same map, with the same stripes, prints in about a second.
* **Countries with no data vanished from `animate_world()` and got their own
  panel in `facet_map(facet = year)`.** `attach_geometry()` gives a country
  the data does not cover an `NA` year, so it belonged to no frame: the
  animation never drew it (gganimate warned twice while dropping it) and the
  small multiples drew it in an extra panel labelled `NA`. It is now drawn,
  as no data, in every period.
* **`value_by_alpha_map()` and the value-suppressing palette ranked polygon
  vertices, not countries.** The polygon backend repeats a country's values
  down every vertex of its outline, so the default `transform = "rank"`
  weighted each country by how complex the outlines below it are: Chile, at
  the 69th percentile of countries by population, was drawn at the 30th, and
  the mean opacity error across 210 countries was 0.25. `world_map(uncertainty
  = )` ranked the same way and put 101 of 189 countries in the wrong value x
  uncertainty cell. Both now rank one value per country, as the quantile
  breaks always have.
* **`attach_geometry()` let a column of the caller's replace the map
  geometry.** A shared name keeps the caller's version, so a `group`, `lat`,
  `long` or `order` column (a treatment group, a capital's latitude) displaced
  the polygon backend's own, and every map drawn from the result was nonsense:
  a two-value `group` drew the world as three polygons. That is now refused,
  naming the column; the `sf` backend is unaffected.
* **`historical_geometry()` gave the Soviet Union Russia's code.** Gleditsch
  and Ward use one code for both, so the 1980 USSR came back as `iso3c =
  "RUS"` and `attach_geometry(year = 1980)` painted all fifteen republics with
  Russia's value, the anachronism `audit_time_coverage()` reports as
  `"before_existence"`. A code now stays `NA` until `historical_codes` says
  the state existed. `?historical_geometry` also said `owner` is `NA` for a
  sovereign state (it is the state's own code) and named the Gold Coast as an
  entity with no code (CShapes calls it Ghana and it carries `"GHA"`).
* **A non-breaking space turned the USSR into Russia.** The historical-name
  lookup trimmed only ASCII whitespace, so `"USSR"` pasted from a web page
  missed its alias and fell through to countrycode, which resolves it to
  Russia alone: `dissolve_country()` returned one row instead of fifteen,
  `check_country_match()` did not flag it historical, and
  `country_timeline()` answered for Russia.
* **`lisa_map()` reported two different coverages.** Its caption counted the
  countries it coloured while `map_provenance()` counted every country with a
  value, including the ones the weights could not connect, which are drawn as
  no-data: 142 against 189 on the bundled snapshot. Provenance now counts
  what is drawn.
* **`od_map()` dropped flows the basemap cannot draw without saying so.**
  Hong Kong, Macao, Tuvalu, the British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar have no
  polygon on the polygon backend, so China's largest destination simply
  vanished from China's panel. They are now named in a warning.
* **`convergence_club()` dropped countries without a complete series.** A
  country with one missing year disappeared from the result altogether; it
  now comes back as `club = NA`, the documented "not classified", with a
  warning naming it.
* **`smooth_rates()` let a negative count into its model.** The pooled rate
  and excess variance went off their domain, every `_shrinkage` came back
  above 1 (the help promises 0 to 1) and rates were pushed away from the
  global one. A negative count is now unusable and reported. The
  unusable-denominator warning also counted rows whose *numerator* was
  missing; it counts denominators only. `rate_check()` reported a standard
  error of exactly 0 for a negative rate and now gives `NA`, with a warning.
* **`world_map(uncertainty = , n_bins = )` said `n_bins` was ignored while
  using it**, for the value classes of the palette. The notice is gone there;
  `n_uncertainty` without `uncertainty`, which really does nothing, now says
  so instead.
* **`join_world()` replaced a caller's `region`, `continent` or `iso2c`
  column in silence**, where `standardize_country()` warns. It now warns too,
  when a value actually changes.
* **One unmatched name in a `region` vector was dropped in silence.**
  `region = c("France", "Germny")` drew France alone; the name that matched
  nothing is now reported, and a continent or group name inside a vector,
  which `region` accepts only on its own, is explained rather than called a
  failed match.
* **`growth_rate()` read the row after an infinity as -100%.** Anything
  finite over `Inf` is 0, so `type = "yoy"` gave -1 after an infinite value
  and `type = "cagr"` gave -1 for every year of a series starting at one.
  Both are `NA` now, with a warning.
* **`audit_coverage()` counted an infinite value as present**, while
  `coverage_map()`, which both help pages call the same report as a map,
  shows it as missing. It counts as missing in both now.
* **`world_map(engine = "tmap", style = "binned")` drew pretty breaks.** The
  ggplot2 engine draws `n_bins` equal intervals; the tmap engine now does too.
* **A blank `iso3c` was reported as an excluded country** by `morans_i()`,
  `gearys_c()` and the other spatial statistics, inflating `n_excluded`.
* **A custom weights frame naming one link twice kept only the last weight.**
  It is now refused, with advice to sum repeated flows first.
* **`standardize_subnational()` refused a lowercase or padded ISO 3166-2
  code** (`"de-by"`, `"DE-BY "`), under a message promising case-insensitive
  matching. Codes are upper-cased and trimmed first.
* **A bad `countryatlas.cache_max_age` or `countryatlas.cache_max_size` was
  blamed on the cache directory.** `"a"` or `NA` switched persistent caching
  off with "Cannot write to the cache directory"; a negative value was
  accepted. Both options are now validated when read, naming the option.
* **`bivariate_map()` did not validate `dim`**, so `"a"`, `NA`, `c(2, 3)` or
  `2.5` failed in base R or in biscale; a custom biscale palette also turned
  the provenance `style` into one string per colour.
* **`interactive_map()` crashed on a fill with nothing to scale.** The
  leaflet engine died on "Wasn't able to determine range of domain" for an
  all-missing numeric column, and the mapgl engine refused an all-missing
  column and failed on a constant one or one with a single country's value
  ("`values` and `stops` must have the same length"). Such a map now draws
  as no-data, as the ggplot2 engines always did.
* **`interactive_map(engine = "plotly", projection = "orthographic")` failed
  inside plotly** ("number of columns of matrices must match"), whose
  converter cannot take an orthographic view. It now says so and names the
  engines that can.
* **`country_factsheet()` misreported neighbours it had not computed.** With
  the lookup unavailable (no `sf`), France's sheet blamed the 110m basemap for
  "excluding" Andorra and Monaco, and Andorra's said "None found". The sheet
  now says the neighbours were not computed, and why.
* `?share_of_world` promised a proportion in `[0, 1]` and `?index_to` said
  nothing about a negative base year; both now say what a negative value
  does.
* `compare_sources()` names a source listed twice rather than failing on
  duplicated column names, and a non-finite `year` passed to `world_data()` or
  `country_data()` is refused as such rather than leaking a coercion warning.
* **`cartogram_map()` and `dorling_map()` failed in the orthographic
  projection**, inside cartogram ("all sizes are missing and/or
  non-positive"), because the far side's vertices were dropped rather than
  cut at the horizon. They now draw the visible hemisphere. A contiguous
  cartogram in Winkel Tripel also failed when printed, on a graticule the
  theme never shows.
* **`growth_rate(type = "cagr")` gave a country with a zero base year `NA`
  without saying so**, and when that was every country, blamed the series for
  being shorter than two years. It now names them.
* **`deflate()` left a row `NA` in silence** when its year's index was zero,
  infinite or missing, where `to_ppp()` and `per_capita()` report the same
  thing. It now says how many rows.
* **`compare_sources()` crashed on a year no source covers**, with base R's
  "subscript out of bounds"; it now returns the empty comparison with a
  warning. An infinite value made the relative difference `NaN`, which
  `disagrees` counted as agreement; it is left out of the comparison and
  named.
* **`recenter = 360` or `-360` failed on the `sf` backend** with sf's
  "polygons require at least 4 points", as did an out-of-range value such as
  `500`, which is now refused by name before any geometry is touched.
* **`bubble_map()` ignored `projection` on its default polygon backend
  without saying so**, as `world_map()` already reports; it now names
  `backend = "sf"` as the way to project.
* **Errors named functions the caller never called.** A bare column passed
  to one of the string-taking arguments was reported as "Error in
  `value[[3L]]()`" (a `tryCatch()` handler), a missing column in
  `country_join_all()` as "Error in `FUN()`", and a bad `origin`, weights
  matrix, `scale`, `region`, `footnote` or override table under an internal
  helper's name such as `wdj_to_iso3c()` or `weights_custom()`. Each now names
  the verb. A bad global option is reported without a call.
* **The on-disk cache could delete files it had not written.** With
  `options(countryatlas.cache_dir = )` pointed at a folder that held anything
  else, the first cached fetch deleted every file in it without an `.rds`
  extension (a sweep meant for entries left by 2.0.x), cachem's 30-day expiry
  and size cap applied to every `.rds` file there, and
  `clear_wdi_cache(disk = TRUE)` removed the folder and everything below it.
  Entries now carry their own `.countryatlas` extension, pruning and clearing
  touch only files the cache wrote, and the folder itself is removed only when
  that leaves it empty.
* **`local_morans()` did not permute conditionally, as it documents.** It
  shuffled all *n* values with one permutation shared by every country, so a
  country's own value could land among its neighbours. For the extreme values a
  hot-spot map is about, that inflated the pseudo p-value: Monaco came out at
  0.028 where the conditional reference distribution (and spdep's
  `localmoran_perm()`) gives 0.0035. Each country's neighbours are now drawn
  from the other *n* - 1 values.
* **`convergence_club()` depended on row order.** `pivot_wider()` lays its
  columns out in order of first appearance and the log-t test reads them by
  position, so a shuffled panel, or one whose first country lacked the first
  year, formed different clubs from the same data. The years are sorted first.
* **`smooth_rates()` shrank every year of a panel toward the earliest year's
  global rate**, under a warning that said the other years were dropped though
  every row came back. The empirical-Bayes prior is now estimated per year,
  the design `spatial_lag()` already uses for a panel.
* **`bubble_map()` drew a negative total as a bubble of its absolute value**
  (France at -1.4e9 as large as China) and an infinite one as an infinite
  bubble. `bubble_map()` and `spike_map()` now set negative and infinite values
  aside with a warning and count them as missing; `spike_map()` used to drop
  them and blame a missing centroid. A missing size on the polygon backend no
  longer leaks ggplot2's "Removed 1 row" at print time.
* **An infinite fill was counted as shown.** Every fill scale draws `Inf` as no
  data, but the `footnote = "auto"` caption, `map_provenance()` and
  `coverage_map()` counted it as present: "189 of 240 countries shown" over a
  map showing 187. It now counts as missing everywhere, `na_style = "omit"` and
  `"hatched"` treat it as the no-data it is drawn as, and the map verbs name
  the countries holding one. `interactive_map(engine = "leaflet")` no longer
  fails on one with leaflet's "Wasn't able to determine range of domain".
* **`flow_map()` with a missing or infinite weight** leaked "Removed 50 rows",
  or failed at print time with grid's "'lwd' must be non-negative and finite".
  Those flows are dropped with a warning, as `flow_matrix()` drops them.
  `cartogram_map()` and `dorling_map()` likewise name an infinite weight
  instead of handing it to cartogram.
* **`growth_rate(type = "yoy")` returned `Inf` and `NaN` after a zero**, where
  every sibling verb gives `NA` for a zero denominator. It now gives `NA`, with
  a warning.
* **A row with a missing `year` was treated as the latest year.**
  `lag_by_country()`, `diff_by_country()` and `growth_rate()` gave it a value
  computed from the last real year, `beta_convergence()` dropped its whole
  country, `sigma_convergence()` and `share_of_world()` reported a phantom `NA`
  year, and `interpolate_missing()` crashed on it, and could have overwritten
  an undated observed value with `NA`. Undated rows are now left out of
  anything that needs a position in time.
* **`complete_years(method = "locf")` carried values in row order**, not time
  order, when the data held years outside `years`, and returned the frame out
  of order.
* **The United Kingdom left the EU a day early.** `country_groups_history`
  reads `to` as the first day of non-membership (Austria left EFTA and joined
  the EU on 1995-01-01), but the UK's exit was recorded as 2020-01-31, its last
  day as a member. It is now 2020-02-01, and the column's help states the
  convention.
* **`projection_distortion()` measured a WGS84 projection against a sphere.**
  Equal Earth read between 0.9955 and 1.009 instead of 1, and Mercator showed
  up to 0.38 degrees of angular distortion, contradicting both checks its
  documentation offers. It now uses the ellipsoid's radii of curvature and
  central differences: Equal Earth, Gall-Peters and the Lambert azimuthals read
  1, Mercator 0, and the 0.7% that Mollweide and Eckert IV show (PROJ applies
  their spherical formulas to the ellipsoid) is documented.
* **`theil(na.rm = FALSE)` broke its own decomposition on a missing group.**
  The row stayed in `total` and fell out of both components, so `total` no
  longer equalled `between + within`. It now returns `NA`, as it already does
  for a missing value under `na.rm = FALSE`.
* **Reports that said something false.** `country_timeline()` warned that
  "Tanganyika", "Zanzibar" and the "United Arab Republic" matched nothing while
  returning their history. `audit_time_coverage()` returned a phantom all-`NA`
  row for an unreadable year, and now names the dissolved codes it flags.
  `compare_sources()` kept unresolved keys as `iso3c = NA` rows, counted them
  in `only_x`/`only_y`, and called two of them "a duplicate country".
  `index_to()` and `deflate()` reported two unidentified countries as "1
  country: NA". `world_table()` gave tied values different ranks.
  `country_join()` and `country_join_all()` warned that `iso3c` was "replaced"
  when it was the join column itself. `subnational_map(projection = )` printed
  raw cli markup and advised `geometry = "sf"`. `audit_coverage()` left a blank
  code out of `unmatched`, and `check_dispute_coverage()` listed `NA` and
  repeated values as bad codes.
* **Inputs accepted and then failed somewhere else.** A numeric `region` that
  is not a four-number box (`region = 250`) drew an empty map, and a reversed
  box was accepted. Custom `country_weights()` codes were taken verbatim, so
  lowercase ones made every statistic report "Not enough connected countries"
  with advice about islands; they are normalised, and codes that differ only in
  case are now named as the key problem they are. `spatial_lag()` on a panel
  aborted entirely when one year was too sparse. `deflate()`, `to_ppp()` and
  `rate_check(rate = )` did not check that their value column was numeric, and
  `per_capita()`, `to_ppp()` and `add_indicator()` leaked dplyr's join-type
  error for a character `year`. `value_by_alpha_map()` drew a character
  `value` as categories labelled "quantile". `classify_compare()`,
  `projection_compare()` and `od_map()` died on "factor level [2] is
  duplicated" for a repeated method, projection or origin.
  `country_join_all(by = iso3c)` gave "object 'iso3c' not found".
  `historical_geometry(Inf)` failed inside `as.Date()`, `locate_country()` on
  zero points leaked four base R warnings, and
  `as_ggsql_source(format = "parquet")` left its connection open when the
  write failed.

* **`interactive_map(engine = "leaflet")` hard-wired a numeric colour scale.**
  A discrete fill reached `leaflet::colorNumeric()` and died inside leaflet
  with "Wasn't able to determine range of domain" -- the same defect
  `auto_fill_scale()` was written to fix for the ggplot2 engines, and that the
  `mapgl` engine handles with `match_expr()`. `?interactive_map` documents no
  per-engine restriction on `fill`, so the leaflet engine now branches on the
  column's type and uses `colorFactor()` for a discrete one.
* **The leaflet engine could be broken by a column named `pal`.** Its
  `fillColor = ~ pal(get(fill_name))` formula was evaluated by leaflet against
  the data as an environment, so a column of that name was found before the
  palette function and then called. The values are computed directly now, which
  also removes the only `get()`-in-a-formula column read in the package.
* **The leaflet and ggiraph engines read `iso3c` without checking for it.**
  `check_cols()` covered `fill` and `tooltip`, and `check_map_geometry()` does
  not require a key, so an `sf` frame without one failed at render time from
  inside leaflet or rlang. Both now name the missing column.
* **`bubble_map(backend = "sf")` carried two geometry columns.**
  `as_tibble()` strips the `sf` class but leaves the live `sfc` column, so the
  `st_drop_geometry()` further down saw a plain tibble and returned it
  unchanged -- and the join then produced `geometry.x` / `geometry.y`, renaming
  the active column out from under `coord_sf()`. It now uses `sf_drop()` first,
  as four other verbs already do.
* **`index_to()` returned an all-`NA` column in silence, three ways.** It and
  `deflate()` take the same `base_year` and match it the same way, and
  `deflate()` reports every case where the rebasing cannot happen while this
  reported none. A `Date` or `POSIXct` `year` was the worst: `==` coerces the
  *number* to that class, so `as.Date("2000-01-01") == 2000` compares against
  1970-01-01 plus 2000 days and is false for every row -- every country
  indexed to `NA`, and `read.csv()` with a date-parsing reader produces
  exactly that column. That shape is now refused by name. A `base_year` the
  panel does not cover, and a country whose base-year value is missing or
  zero, still come back `NA` as documented -- but the verb now names the
  countries it could not index, so an all-`NA` column is readable rather than
  indistinguishable from a source that had no data. A *character* `year` still
  works, deliberately: this verb only matches on the year, and `"2000" ==
  2000` is true.
* **`deflate()` aborted on a zero-row panel**, reporting "Years present: Inf
  and -Inf" from `range()` of nothing, and would have asked the World Bank for
  the year range `Inf..-Inf`. It returns early with the promised column,
  typed.
* **`rate_check()` warned that a zero-row frame had no usable denominator.**
  `quantile()` of an empty vector is `NA` too, so the guard for an all-`NA`
  denominator fired for a frame that simply had no rows.
* **`beta_convergence()` and `convergence_club()` leaked base R's "essentially
  perfect fit: summary may be unreliable".** It named neither the verb nor the
  column, and from `convergence_club()` it described an internal log-t
  regression the caller does not know exists. `beta_convergence()` now says so
  in the package's own voice -- naming which columns are meaningless as a
  result -- and the internal fit is silent.
* **`simplify_geometry()` skipped its documented MULTIPOLYGON cast for an
  `sfc`.** The validator accepts `sf` and `sfc`; the cast gated on `sf` alone,
  so half the accepted inputs came back as a mix of POLYGON and MULTIPOLYGON.
* **`world_table(engine = "gt")` rendered `year` as "2,020".** `year` now joins
  `rank` in the columns `fmt_number()` leaves alone -- it is an identifier, not
  a measurement.
* **`tile_map()`'s provenance called a numeric fill "categorical".**
  `auto_fill_scale()` picks the scale from the column's type, so a numeric fill
  was drawn continuously and recorded as categorical, in the record whose job
  is to say what was drawn.
* **`split_antimeridian()` wired up only the last crossing.** A carry row was
  computed and stored for every crossing but only the last was read, so with
  two or more crossings the middle segments began at their first raw vertex
  instead of at the antimeridian edge, leaving a visible break on the re-entry
  side. The code read as though it were general; it handled one.
* **A `region` that resolves to `NA` codes selected uncoded geometry.**
  `resolve_region()`'s continent branch reads countrycode's codelist, where a
  few rows carry a continent and no `iso3c`, and `%in%` treats `NA` as a value
  -- so `NA %in% c("FRA", NA)` is `TRUE` and a subset keyed on the result
  pulled in every geometry row whose own `iso3c` was `NA`. The `sf` backend
  guarded this; the polygon backend did not. The codes are now filtered at the
  source, so all callers are covered.
* **`country_overrides()` accepted any string as an `iso3c` value.**
  `wdj_to_iso3c()` whitelists every override value as a legitimate code, so
  `country_overrides(c(Freedonia = "1"))` put `"1"` in the `iso3c` column and
  every join keyed on it. Values must now look like an ISO 3166-1 alpha-3
  code. Separately, `any(!nzchar(nms))` missed an `NA` name -- `nzchar(NA)` is
  `TRUE` -- while `wdj_to_iso3c()` rejected one, so the two validators
  disagreed about what a valid override table is.
* **`world_query()` interpolated identifiers into SQL without escaping them.** Only `title`
  was escaped, and it is the one value that lands inside quotes; every other
  name went in as bare SQL. A column name with a space produced invalid SQL
  with no diagnostic, and a name derived from untrusted input reached a string
  that `ggsql::ggsql_execute()` then runs. `fill`, `source`, `size`, `facet`,
  `projection`, `palette` and `transform` are now checked against a plain SQL
  identifier.
* **`nuts_geometry(countries = "Germany")`** said "NUTS covers the EU, EFTA and
  candidate countries only" -- true, and not the problem. `countries` is read
  as `iso3c`, so a country name resolves to nothing; the error now names the
  origin that would have worked.
* **`od_map()`'s `origin` and `origins`** are one letter apart and adjacent in
  the signature, and mean unrelated things. Both mix-ups used to fail somewhere
  else; each is now diagnosed where it was made.
* **`geom_country_labels()` did not validate `size` or `mapping`**, which feed
  ggplot2 arithmetic and `modifyList()` respectively; `world_table()` checked
  `title` but not `subtitle`; and `ggsql_wkb_frame()` overwrote an existing
  column of the geometry column's name in silence, where eleven other
  column-adding verbs warn.
* **`world_query()` silently ignored arguments its layer does not use.** `size`
  belongs to `layer = "bubble"` and `n_bins` to `layer = "binned"`, and the
  other layers took them without a word: `n_bins` was dropped, since only the
  binned layer emits a `BIN` clause, while `size` still went into the
  `VISUALISE` list as `pop AS size` on a choropleth, which has no size channel
  to put it on. Both are now reported, together when both are given. The
  emitted query is unchanged -- a pass-through builder passing a clause through
  is defensible -- but the silence was not, since the abort beside it already
  treats a layer/argument mismatch as worth naming.

* **`globe_map()` crashed at some viewpoints with an error from the geometry
  engine.** `globe_map(sf_data, lon = 90, lat = 30)` died on
  `IllegalArgumentException: point array must contain 0 or >1 elements`, which
  names neither the projection nor the viewpoint. `coord_sf()` draws a
  graticule, and on the one genuinely hemispheric projection those lines are
  clipped at the horizon -- a clipped line can reduce to a *single* point,
  which GEOS rejects. `winkel_tripel` already had `datum = NA` for its own
  graticule trouble; `"orthographic"` now does too, and all 65 sampled
  viewpoints draw. The other three azimuthal projections show the whole globe,
  so nothing is clipped and they are unaffected.

* **`country_weights()` silently ignored the arguments its scheme does not
  use.** `k`, `cutoff_km`, `w` and `scale` each belong to exactly one scheme,
  and the other three dropped them without a word. The costly case is
  `country_weights("knn", w = my_matrix)`: the caller's own adjacency matrix was
  discarded and nearest-neighbour weights returned instead, so the result looks
  entirely reasonable and is not what was asked for. `cutoff_km` passed to
  `"knn"` reads as a distance cap that was never applied, and `scale` only ever
  affected `"contiguity"`. All eleven combinations now report which arguments
  were ignored and which one the chosen scheme is built from; each scheme's own
  argument, the shared `style`, and a default passed explicitly stay quiet.

* **Arguments that do not apply were silently ignored by the map verbs.** The
  package reports an inert argument rather than pretending to honour it --
  that is what `warn_projection_ignored()` and `warn_recenter_ignored()` are
  for, and `attach_geometry()`, `world_geometry()`, `world_data()` and
  `join_world()` all call them. `world_map()` did not, though it takes both
  arguments and is the verb people actually reach for: on the polygon backend,
  which draws in unprojected longitude/latitude, `projection = "mollweide"`
  and `recenter = 180` looked honoured and changed nothing. `n_bins` was inert
  in the same way under `style = "continuous"` (a colourbar has no classes)
  and `style = "categorical"` (the classes are the values) -- the same
  complaint the 3.0.0 fix for `style = "binned"` answered. All three are now
  reported, under `countryatlas_projection_ignored`,
  `countryatlas_recenter_ignored` and `countryatlas_n_bins_ignored`, and
  `value_by_alpha_map()` gets the two that apply to it since it carries its own
  copies of those arguments. `facet_map()` and `coverage_map()` inherit them by
  passing `...` through.

* **`attach_geometry(year = )` warned about the caller's frame size, not the
  geometry.** Its threshold was `matched < nrow(geom) * 0.5`, so an ordinary
  three-country frame -- 3 of the 97 entities CShapes has for 1960 -- was told
  "only 3 of 97 historical entities matched" and advised to join on `gwcode`
  "for full historical coverage", which is not what someone asking for three
  countries wants. What the message claimed is a property of CShapes rather
  than of the request: a few entities never had an ISO code (6 of 97 in 1960,
  3 of 174 in 2019) and no `iso3c` join can reach them. That is what it now
  reports, independently of the frame, and the nothing-matched case is left to
  the same helper every other geometry verb uses. The whole historical branch
  had no test coverage.

* **A missing-column error named an argument the function does not have.**
  `check_cols()` wrote `` `data` `` into its message unconditionally, which is
  right for the twenty-odd verbs whose frame argument is called that and wrong
  for the three whose is not: `country_weights(w = )` reported ``Columns
  "iso3c" and "neighbor" not found in `data``` and
  `cartogram_diagnostics(x = )` reported ``Column "nope" not found in
  `data```. The helper now takes the name to use, and the duplicated-column
  error beside it does too.

* **A provider renaming its time column turned the years into the values.**
  `adapter_reshape()` -- the shared step that puts a provider's response into
  the package's shape, behind `fetch_owid()`, `fetch_eurostat()`,
  `fetch_oecd()` and `fetch_comtrade()` -- checked that the entity and value
  columns exist but not the year column. The value column is auto-detected as
  the first numeric column *other than the year*, excluded by name, so with the
  year column missing the exclusion removed nothing and the provider's own time
  column was picked as the indicator: the mapped values came back as 2000,
  2001, 2002 while `year` was entirely `NA`, with nothing said. A missing year
  column is now reported like the missing value column beside it.

* **`locate_country()` gave a raw sf error for a points object with no CRS.**
  `sf::st_as_sf(df, coords = c("lon", "lat"))` leaves the CRS missing whenever
  `crs` is forgotten, and the object then reached `st_transform()` and came
  back with sf's "cannot transform sfc object with missing crs" -- naming
  neither the argument nor the fix. The non-sf case one line above had already
  been given a proper message; this is the same failure one step further in.
  It now says which argument is at fault and how to set the CRS.

* **`subnational_map()` joined against the wrong column when the caller's code
  column collided with the geometry's.** The geometry side is meant to be
  `nuts_id` "whatever the caller's column is called", but the guard was
  `if (!by %in% names(geom))` -- false exactly when `by` names one of the
  geometry's own columns. `by = "name"` therefore joined the caller's NUTS
  codes against the geometry's region *names* and matched nothing, and
  `by = "iso3c"` silently joined at country granularity instead of regional.
  `by` is documented as "the code column in `data`", so the geometry side is
  now always `nuts_id`.

* **`subnational_map()` blamed the codes for an all-`NA` indicator.** It counted
  matches as `sum(!is.na(fill))`, so a panel whose indicator is entirely `NA`
  -- a real thing to map, and one this package draws with an `na.value` and
  reports in the caption -- was refused with "no rows matched the geometry",
  sending the reader to check NUTS vintages for a mismatch that never happened.
  The count is now taken on the join key. Both of these sat in code that no
  test reached, because the path needs a GISCO download: `R/subnational.R` was
  at 66% coverage where every other file was above 90%. It is now exercised
  with a mocked `nuts_geometry()`.

* **`correlate_indicators()` let a tidyselect error through for a missing
  column.** Every other verb reports one as ``Column "x" not found in `data```;
  this one selected through `dplyr::select()` and surfaced the
  `vctrs_error_subscript_oob` raised by tidyselect -- "Can't select columns
  that don't exist" -- which was the last error at this boundary not carrying
  the package's class.
  The selection is a full tidyselect expression, so it cannot be checked by
  name up front; the failure is caught and re-worded instead, and
  `starts_with()`, `where()`, ranges, bare columns and the no-argument form all
  still work.

* **Rows whose `iso3c` did not resolve were treated as one country.**
  `dplyr::group_by()` puts every `NA` in a single group, so a panel carrying
  two unmatched names was one country to every verb that reads a neighbouring
  row within it: `growth_rate()` reported the change from one unmatched row to
  the next -- 899% between two unrelated countries -- and `lag_by_country()`,
  `diff_by_country()`, `index_to()`, `interpolate_missing()`, `deflate()` and
  `beta_convergence()` read across them the same way, silently. That frame is
  exactly the one a user is most likely to hold, because
  `standardize_country()` has already warned that those names did not match
  and left their `iso3c` as `NA`. The grouping now falls back to whatever does
  identify the row -- the same `country`, then `group` order
  `distinct_countries()` uses for its uncoded branch -- so an appended
  aggregate row (no `iso3c`, `country = "World"`) still groups as one series,
  while rows nothing identifies each get a key of their own and are no longer
  read across. `complete_years()` had the same conflation twice over: the two
  unresolved rows shared one completed year grid, and the geometry carry that
  gives invented rows their country's shape matched on `iso3c` -- where
  `match()` treats `NA` as equal to `NA` -- so it copied one unidentified
  country's polygon onto the other's invented rows. Both are keyed on the unit
  now, and each unresolved row gets its own grid and its own shape.

  A blank code is treated the same way. `""` is not `NA`, so every `is.na()`
  guard missed it -- but `read.csv()` without `na.strings = ""` gives a blank
  for every empty cell, and `standardize_country("")` already resolves to
  `iso3c = NA`, so a blank identifies no country anywhere else in the package.
  Two blank-coded rows produced the same fabricated 899%. Whitespace-only codes
  count as blank too, using the same Unicode `[\h\v]` class
  `standardize_country()` uses rather than `trimws()`'s ASCII-only default.

  The two panel guards were keyed on `iso3c` while the verbs grouped by the
  unit, which made them disagree: four single-year unidentified rows were
  reported as one country with gaps between them, and two unidentified rows in
  the same year as a duplicated country-year. Both now key on the unit, so
  they describe what the verb actually did; a genuinely duplicated
  country-year and a genuinely irregular panel are still reported.

* **The unparseable-year warning printed its own markup and padded its list
  with `NA`s.** Two defects in one message. cli does not re-interpolate a
  substituted value, so `{source_label}` emitted the label verbatim: three of
  the six call sites showed users `` `{.arg data}`: 2 time values are not a
  year `` and, from the public source extension point, `Source {.val
  {source}}:` -- where the braces also referenced a variable that exists only
  in the caller's frame. Separately, the list of offending values was sliced to
  `min(4, sum(bad))`, sizing it by the number of bad *rows* while the values
  themselves were de-duplicated, so a column of one repeated placeholder --
  `"N/A"`, `".."`, `"-"`, the common case -- read `"N/A", NA, NA, and NA`. The
  label is now pre-rendered in the caller's environment and the list is taken
  with `head()`, so the warning names its source and shows only values that
  are really there.

* **`audit_time_coverage()` invented history for a factor `iso3c`.** It looked
  the dissolution and succession dates up by indexing a *named* vector with the
  frame's `iso3c` column -- and indexing a named vector with a **factor**
  selects by the factor's integer codes, not its labels. A frame from
  `read.csv(stringsAsFactors = TRUE)` therefore matched whichever rows of
  `historical_codes` happened to sit at those positions: a clean panel of
  France, Germany, Italy and Spain came back reporting France dissolved in
  1993, Italy in 1992, Spain in 1991 and Germany as existing only from 2010,
  from the one verb whose whole job is catching that kind of mistake. The
  `year` key had already been hardened against the same class of bug (a `Date`
  year became a day count, hence `read_year()`); the `iso3c` key had not. The
  column is now coerced before the lookup, so a factor `iso3c` gives the same
  answer as a character one -- verified across 27 verbs, none of which now
  differ on a factor `iso3c` or an integer value column.

* **A stray 60 KB `Rplots.pdf` shipped inside the source tarball.** Printing a
  plot with no device open makes R open the default one, which in a
  non-interactive session writes `Rplots.pdf` into the working directory -- for
  the test suite, `tests/testthat`. `.Rbuildignore` carried `^Rplots\.pdf$`,
  anchored at the package root, so it matched the root copy and not the nested
  one, and `R CMD build` included the artefact. The pattern is now unanchored,
  and a test setup file points the default device at the null file so the file
  is not written in the first place -- plots still render, so a drawing error
  still fails a test.

* **A factor `year` column silently produced wrong numbers.** `dplyr::arrange()`
  and `order()` sort a factor by its **level index**, not by the label, and
  `stats::approx()` coerces a factor the same way. A year column arrives as a
  factor more often than it looks -- `read.csv(stringsAsFactors = TRUE)`, some
  importers, and any deliberate `factor(year)` for plotting -- and every verb
  that reads a *neighbouring* row then read the wrong neighbour.
  `lag_by_country()` and `diff_by_country()` took the value from the wrong
  year, `growth_rate()` reported `-0.75` on a series that had doubled, and
  `interpolate_missing()` left the gap `NA` because the targets fell outside
  the anchors it had mis-placed. Nothing warned: the panel came back the right
  shape with the wrong values. `warn_irregular_years()` had the same trap from
  the other side -- `as.numeric()` on a factor returns level indices, so it
  reported a perfectly regular annual panel as having gaps. The nine
  year-ordering sites, the linear interpolation path and the gap check now go
  through one `year_sort_key()` helper, so a factor or character year gives the
  same answers as a numeric one, and the gap warning is now classed
  `countryatlas_irregular_years` so a deliberately decadal panel can silence
  just that one. `earliest_per_unit()` had carried this coercion since 2.0.0,
  which is why the map-drawing path was
  unaffected and this survived. A year column that is not numeric at all -- an
  ordered factor of period labels -- still sorts by its own order, and
  `complete_years()` still asks for a numeric year, since it has to generate
  the grid rather than merely order it.

* **A bare column name was reported as "object not found" by six arguments.**
  A handful of arguments take a column name as a *string* while the verbs
  around them take a bare column through tidy eval, so the package converts
  that predictable slip into a message naming the argument and showing the
  quoted form to write. The conversion had been applied to the `value`,
  `indicator`, `columns`, `codes` and `by` arguments of `interpolate_missing()`,
  `complete_years()`, `audit_coverage()`, `world_table()`, `country_codes()`
  and `aggregate_regions()`, and not to the join-key and query arguments of
  the same shape: `aggregate_regions(by = region)` explained
  itself while `attach_geometry(by = iso3c)`, `subnational_map(by = nuts_id)`,
  `register_country_source(key_col = iso3c)`, `world_query(facet = year)`,
  `world_query(size = pop)` and `as_ggsql_source(geometry_col = geom)` all
  reached the user as base R's "object 'iso3c' not found". All six now report
  the argument and the fix. A genuine error inside such an argument still
  surfaces as itself.

* **The plotting verbs rejected a column passed as a string.** Every unquoted
  column argument in the package goes through one helper, whose own error hint
  tells the user to "pass the column unquoted (`fill = my_col`) or as a
  string", and the column check then accepted the string form happily. But
  `world_map()`, `tile_map()`, `bubble_map()` and `interactive_map()` spliced
  the captured expression straight into `aes()`, which honours only the
  unquoted form: `fill = "value"` mapped the constant string `"value"`. The failure then arrived at
  *build* time, from ggplot2, as "Discrete value supplied to a continuous
  scale" (or "Binned scales only support continuous data" under `style =
  "binned"`) -- naming neither the argument, nor the column, nor the fix, which
  is the exact failure the helper exists to prevent. `world_map(d, "value")` --
  the package's most common call -- errored while `world_map(d, value)` drew.
  The mapping is now built from the validated column *name*, so both forms
  produce the same plot; `coverage_map()`, `spike_map()` and the `quantile`,
  `jenks` and `categorical` styles were already correct, which is why this
  survived.

* **`interpolate_missing()` invented data across decades.** `max_gap` is
  documented as "the longest run of consecutive missing *years* to fill ...
  because interpolating across a decade is not interpolation", and it counted
  missing **rows**. On any panel that is not annual the guard was therefore
  defeated: a decadal panel of 2000, 2010, 2020 with 2010 missing is one
  missing row, so the default `max_gap = 3` filled it -- placing an invented
  value ten years from either anchor, the exact thing the parameter exists to
  refuse. Five-yearly data was interpolated across 15 years the same way.
  A run is now refused if it is longer than `max_gap` in rows -- which is what
  an annual panel means by consecutive missing years, so annual behaviour is
  unchanged -- or if any filled year sits further than `max_gap` from its
  *nearest* observation, which is what makes the decadal case wrong. Measuring
  the bracketing span instead would have been too blunt: on 2000, 2001, 2005
  the filled 2001 is one year from an anchor and interpolating it is sound,
  even though the span is five. The documentation was already right; the code
  has caught up with it.

* **`interpolate_missing(method = "linear")` leaked a dplyr internal for a
  year it could not read.** Linear interpolation places the filled value
  *along* the year axis via `approx()`, so a labelled year column arrived as
  `NA` and surfaced "need at least two non-NA values to interpolate" wrapped
  in an `across()` error, naming neither the column nor its type. It is now a
  classed error naming the unreadable values and pointing at
  `method = "locf"`, which carries the last value forward in row order and
  needs no arithmetic. It tests whether the year can be *read* as a number
  rather than whether it is numeric, deliberately: `approx()` reads `"2000"`
  happily, so a character year still works here --
  the difference from `deflate()` and `beta_convergence()`, which do the
  arithmetic themselves.

* **`gearys_c()` and `getis_ord()` listed their count columns without saying
  what they count.** `morans_i()` defines all three -- `n` (countries used),
  `n_excluded` (countries with data the weights could not reach), `n_links`
  (non-zero weights) -- and the other two named the same columns and left them
  undefined, so a reader had to go to a third function's page. The counts are
  consistent: verified across all six spatial verbs on one graph, `n` is 187
  everywhere it appears, `n_excluded` 2, `n + n_excluded` is the 189 countries
  supplied, `n_links` matches the non-zero weights, and the local forms return
  exactly `n` rows. All of that is now stated where the columns are listed.

* **`audit_coverage()` did not say which way round its counts run.** Its
  `@return` described the three elements but none of their columns, and both
  `na_rates$n` and `by_group$n_countries` are *denominators* -- everything
  counted, not everything present. That is the opposite orientation from
  `map_provenance()`, whose `n_countries` is the numerator, and the two share
  that column name: on 215 countries with 24 missing, `audit_coverage()` gives
  `n = 215` where `map_provenance()` gives `n_countries = 191`. The package had
  already spelled this out for `map_provenance()` ("the numerator, not the
  denominator, which its name does not say on its own"); the verb whose whole
  purpose is reporting coverage had not. Every column is now defined, with the
  contrast stated. The numbers themselves were correct throughout -- verified
  against the data, including that the group counts sum to `n` and each
  `na_rate` is the within-group share.

* **`as_ggsql_source()` accepted things that are not data, and gave a bare
  error for a closed connection.** `data` is documented as a map-ready frame
  and was never checked, so `as_ggsql_source(1:5)` wrote an integer vector out
  as a table and returned a connection -- a "world source" containing no
  countries at all -- while `NULL` surfaced *Data frame with at least one
  column required*, a message from DuckDB rather than from here. A `con` the caller had already closed reached
  `dbWriteTable()` as base R's unclassed *Invalid connection*, naming neither
  the argument nor its state. Both are now classed errors, checked at the one
  point that knows whose connection it is -- which is also why the existing
  bookkeeping there closes a connection the function opened and leaves one
  passed in alone.

* **A negative or infinite custom weight was accepted and quietly changed the
  answer.** `country_weights("custom", w = )` validated the matrix's dimnames,
  squareness, type and `NA`s, and the type message even promises "any
  non-negative number" -- but nothing enforced it. Row standardisation divides
  by the row sum, so one negative weight moved Moran's I from 0.714 to 0.497
  with no warning, and an *all*-negative matrix cancelled to exactly the
  all-positive answer, discarding the caller's signs entirely. An infinite
  weight normalised to `NaN`, and the verb then reported *not enough connected
  countries with data* -- diagnosing connectivity when the cause was the
  weight. `gini()`, `theil()` and the global G all refuse a negative input for
  the same reason, so both are now classed errors naming how many entries are
  at fault. The long-frame form of `w` gets the same two checks, and all three
  built-in constructors satisfy them.

* **A partly named `custom_match` silently ignored the unnamed entries.** The
  check tested `is.null(names())`, which catches a wholly unnamed vector but
  not `c(Freedonia = "FRA", "DEU")`, whose names are `c("Freedonia", "")`. An
  entry named `""` or `NA` can never match a spelling, so it sat there doing
  nothing while the caller believed it was overriding something -- the same
  silent-but-useless entry the surrounding comment was written about, and
  invisible in the output, unlike a mistyped code which at least shows up in
  the `iso3c` column. Every element must now be named. Values are still not
  checked against the ISO list, deliberately: the package's own overrides map
  Kosovo to `XKX`, a World Bank user-assigned code that is not in
  `countrycode::codelist$iso3c`, so validating that way would reject the very
  case overrides exist for.

* **A custom source that failed, or was written with the wrong signature,
  reported neither.** `register_country_source()`'s boundary checks what an
  adapter *returns* thoroughly -- a non-data-frame, a missing key column and a
  duplicate key are all named and pointed at the fetch contract -- but not the
  call itself. An adapter that raised its own error re-raised it bare, so
  `"provider is down"` reached the caller with nothing to say which source
  produced it; and one defined as `function(indicator)` surfaced R's
  `unused arguments (countries = countries, years = years)`, naming neither the
  source nor the documented arity. Both are what someone developing an adapter
  hits, and both are the one moment the package knows which source it just
  called. They are now classed errors that name the source, preserve the
  provider's own message verbatim (braces included -- a cli template would
  have interpolated them), and point at the contract.

* **A flow between near-antipodal countries was drawn as a streak across the
  top of the map.** `great_circle()` sampled a fixed 50 points along the arc,
  and a near-antipodal arc passes within half a degree of a pole, where
  longitude turns almost arbitrarily fast: Belgium to Tonga stepped 131 degrees
  of longitude between two consecutive points, Greenland to Japan 121, Tonga to
  the Netherlands 136. `split_antimeridian()` only cuts a step wider than 180,
  so none of these were cut and `geom_path()` joined them literally -- the same
  failure that function was written to fix for trans-Pacific flows, caused by
  the pole rather than the antimeridian. 16 of 8010 real ordered country pairs
  hit it, every one at latitude 87 to 89.
    The path itself was right; 50 points is simply too coarse where it turns
  fastest, and the step shrinks in proportion to the sample count. The
  offending segments are now bisected until every step is under 20 degrees, so
  all 8010 pairs come in under that, at a cost of at most 63 points instead of
  50. An ordinary arc never trips the threshold and keeps its `n` points
  exactly.

* **`gridded_cartogram()` now documents that crowded neighbours overlap.**
  Each country's block is centred on its own centroid with no collision
  avoidance -- a deliberate choice, since a global packing solve would push
  countries away from where they belong, and it was recorded in a code comment.
  It was not in the documentation, though, and it is not marginal: at the
  defaults about a third of the cells are drawn on top of a cell belonging to a
  different country, across some sixty countries, rising to roughly two thirds
  at `cells = 2500`. A partly hidden block cannot be counted or compared, which
  is the one thing this verb asks the reader to do. A new section says so,
  quantifies it, and names `cell_size` as the lever -- dropping it from `2.5` to
  `1.5` cuts the overlap at `cells = 1000` to about a tenth -- with a pointer to
  `dorling_map()`, which resolves collisions by displacement instead.

* **`beta_convergence()` returned a silent `NA` for `speed` and `half_life`
  on an unbalanced panel, and the documented reason did not apply.** Turning
  `beta` into an annual rate inverts `beta = -(1 - exp(-lambda T))/T`, which
  needs `1 + beta * T > 0`. That holds whenever every country spans the same
  `T`, but `beta` is fitted on growth already annualised per country, so a mix
  of spans leaves the mean span irreconcilable with the fitted slope. On a
  panel where half the countries were observed for 10 years and half for 50 --
  ordinary coverage for real data -- `beta` came back at -0.041 with
  `p = 9.5e-14` and `r_squared = 0.96`, unmistakable convergence, while the two
  most interpretable columns were blank and the documentation said `NA` meant
  `beta >= 0`, which it plainly was not. The guard itself was right: `log()` of
  a negative is not a speed. It now warns, naming the range of spans and saying
  that `beta` and its inference are unaffected, and the documented `NA`
  conditions list both cases.

* **`local_morans()` returned a `lag` column that was not the neighbour
  average it is documented as.** It reported the lag of the *centred* value,
  which is what the statistic and the quadrants are built on, beside a `value`
  column that is raw -- so the two columns in the same tibble were on
  different scales, and neither matched `spatial_lag()`'s column of the same
  name. That breaks the Moran scatterplot the pair exists for: with `value`
  centred on 17384 and `lag` on 0, the quadrant boundaries fall in different
  places on the two axes, so the usual reference lines disagree with the
  `cluster` column beside them. The reported `lag` is now the plain neighbour
  average, identical to `spatial_lag()`. The centred lag is still what `ii`
  and the four quadrants use internally, which is what Anselin (1995) defines
  them on, so no statistic, p-value or cluster label changes.

* **A value-suppressing uncertainty palette drew nothing when only one
  country was usable.** The two axes are ranked with `percent_rank()`, which
  is `(rank - 1)/(n - 1)` and therefore `NaN` for a single observation, so
  `cut()` returned `NA` and the row got no colour -- a country whose value and
  uncertainty were both present, drawn as though neither were. This is not a
  one-row-input curiosity: a mostly-missing uncertainty column with a single
  usable country blanked the entire VSUP layer. A lone observation has no rank
  position relative to others, so it now lands in the middle of each ramp,
  claiming neither extreme, which is also where a maximally uncertain value
  sits. Rows that are genuinely missing still get no colour, and a palette
  with more than one usable row is unchanged.

* **`rate_check()` ranked a zero-count row as the most reliable in the
  table.** The output is documented as "sorted with the least reliable first",
  and it sorted on `expected_se`, which is the Poisson standard error
  `sqrt(y)/d` -- exactly `0` when the count is `0`. So a country with no
  events out of 251 people sorted *last*, presented as the most trustworthy
  row on the page, while another with one event out of the same 251 sorted
  first as the least trustworthy. Observing nothing is not evidence of
  precision; it is the small-number problem this verb exists to name, and
  nothing else in the output caught it either, because the default threshold
  is a quantile of the denominators. The ordering now uses the standard error
  a single event would imply, `sqrt(max(y, 1))/d`, which is identical to
  `expected_se` for every row with at least one event -- so no other row
  moves -- and `expected_se` itself is unchanged, still the plain Poisson
  standard error.

* **`convergence_club()` found no clubs at all on an indexed panel.** The
  log-t statistic refused to compute whenever `H_1`, the cross-sectional
  dispersion in the *first* period, was zero -- and it is exactly zero
  whenever every country starts equal, which `index_to()` guarantees by
  construction. So the natural pipeline, `convergence_club(index_to(panel,
  value, base_year = ...), value_index)`, silently placed nobody: the same
  panel in levels found seven clubs covering 16 of 20 countries, and indexed
  found none.

  `H_1` cannot affect the answer. `log(H_1/H_t)` is `log(H_1) - log(H_t)`, and
  `log(H_1)` is one constant across the regression, so it lands entirely in
  the intercept while the statistic returned is the *t* on the slope --
  verified bit-identical for `H_1` of 1e-6, 1 and 1e6, and for omitting it
  altogether. The guard now requires only the periods inside the regression
  window to be positive and finite, which also stops earlier periods being
  over-checked when they never enter the fit. A window with genuinely zero
  dispersion is still `NA`, since there is no decay rate to estimate.

* **`repair_country_names()` promised something it does not do.** The
  documentation said the no-`stringdist` fallback "repairs a subset of what
  Jaro-Winkler would ... and never picks a different country". The second half
  is false, and not marginally: the two metrics choose the nearest known name
  independently, so `"Libia"` is repaired to Liberia with `stringdist` and to
  Libya without it, both accepted at the default threshold. Across a
  42-misspelling sweep the two disagreed on the candidate five times, once
  reaching the user as a different substitution. No code change can make two
  different string metrics agree on a nearest neighbour -- and normalising the
  candidate gate in the fallback, which was the obvious repair, agrees *less* often
  (35/42 against 37/42), so the metric is left alone. The documentation now
  says plainly that the engines can land on different countries, recommends
  installing `stringdist`, notes that neither metric is uniformly better
  (Jaro-Winkler repairs `"Maroco"` to Monaco, not Morocco), and points at the
  reported substitutions and the `"repairs"` attribute as the thing to check.
  The same paragraph's aside about transpositions was ambiguously worded and is
  now explicit with the numbers: the fallback charges two edits for a
  transposition, so `"Germny"` is repaired (0.14) and `"Frnace"` is not
  (0.33), where Jaro-Winkler scores the latter 0.06 and repairs it.

* **`getis_ord(local = FALSE)` returned a silent `NaN` in three cases.** The
  global G is a ratio of cross-products, and the denominator is zero when
  every value is zero (`0/0`) or non-finite when the products overflow or
  underflow at extreme magnitudes (`Inf - Inf`, or an underflow to `0`). The
  branch immediately above it already warns and returns `NA` for negative
  values, citing `gini()` as the precedent for "outside the domain is `NA`
  plus a word about why"; these three slipped past it. They now warn and
  return `NA` too, and the overflow message says that the statistic is
  unchanged by a positive scale factor, so rescaling the column fixes it.

* **The permutation p-values did not say which tail they used.** `morans_i()`
  documented its own (one-sided, upper); `local_morans()` and `gearys_c()`
  documented neither their tail nor that they consume the RNG. That matters
  for reading them: `local_morans()` is two-sided, and `gearys_c()` is
  one-sided on the *lower* tail -- the opposite way round from Moran's *I*,
  because Geary's *C* runs from 0 (neighbours identical) up through 1 (no
  autocorrelation), so a small `c` is the evidence of clustering. All three
  now give the formula, note that the p-value can never be exactly zero (its
  floor is 1/(`n_perm` + 1)), and say to set a seed for reproducibility.

* **A categorical map's colours depended on the machine's collation locale.**
  A character fill column reaches ggplot2 unfactored, and its discrete scale
  derives the level order by sorting -- which consults `LC_COLLATE`. The same
  script on the same data gave a legend of *Belgium, Chad, Zambia, aland,
  Åland* under C collation and *aland, Åland, Belgium, Chad, Zambia* under
  `en_US`, so every category was drawn in a different colour and two people
  running identical code got different maps. The level order is now pinned
  byte-wise (`order(method = "radix")`, which is precisely what a plain
  `sort()` does not do), so it is the same everywhere. An incoming factor is
  left alone -- the caller has already chosen an order. Same fix applied to
  `interactive_map()`'s mapgl branch, where the sorted values are paired
  positionally with the colour stops, and to the `classification_report`
  fallback, whose rows came out in a locale-dependent order.

* **`classify_compare()` drew half a panel as grey, and which half depended on
  row order.** It took the class breaks from one arbitrary row per country --
  the same flaw as the break computation behind `world_map()` -- but here every
  row is then `cut()` against those breaks, so the rows the chosen year did not
  cover fell outside the range and came back `NA`. On a two-year panel one
  year classified correctly and the other vanished into `na.value`, and
  swapping the input's row order swapped which. It now de-duplicates
  `(country, value)` pairs, which still collapses the polygon-backend vertex
  rows the de-duplication exists for and spans the panel otherwise.

* **`distinct_countries()` disagreed with itself.** The branch for rows that
  resolved to an ISO code picked the earliest year explicitly; the branch for
  rows that did not, three lines below, still took `distinct()`'s first row.
  A panel carrying an unmatchable country name in two years therefore kept the
  earliest year for every country that resolved and an arbitrary one for the
  country that did not. Both branches now use the same rule.

* **`compare_sources()` dropped duplicate rows in silence.** A provider
  answering twice for one country-year hands back whichever row came first,
  order-dependently. `fetch_wdi()` reports exactly this and its comment argues
  why -- *"this is the response of a third party, which is more reason to"* --
  and this path said nothing. It now warns with the count and says the first
  row was kept.

* **A map's colour classes depended on the caller's row order.** The break
  computation de-duplicated to one row per country, which is right for a
  polygon-backend frame -- one row per vertex, hundreds per country, all
  carrying the same fill, and quantiles must not be weighted by how complex an
  outline is. But it picked an *arbitrary* row when a country's rows genuinely
  differ, i.e. a panel: the same panel handed over in a different order gave
  quantile breaks of `10-100` or of `1000-10000`, so the same data drew a
  different map and nothing said so. It now de-duplicates `(country, value)`
  pairs, which collapses the vertex rows exactly as before and spans the whole
  panel otherwise -- what `facet_map(facet = "year")` wants from a shared
  scale, and order-independent either way.

* **Coverage counts depended on row order too.** `na_coverage()` -- behind the
  `world_map()` caption, `map_provenance()` and the honest-maps verbs -- took
  the first row per country, so the same panel reordered reported 2 of 4
  countries missing or 0 of 4. It now counts a country as shown if any of its
  rows has a value, matching `imputed_count()`; identical on the map-ready
  cross-section it is documented for. This mattered in practice because
  `facet_map(facet = "year")` deliberately hands `world_map()` the whole
  panel, so that arbitrary number was the caption on a plot showing every year.

* **`classification_report = TRUE` reported a different table for the same
  map.** It counts countries per class, so one row per country is the right
  shape, but it too used `distinct()`'s first row. It now takes the earliest
  year, the rule `distinct_countries()` already promised, which is also now
  shared between the two rather than written out twice.

* **`map_provenance()` reported `n_imputed = 0` for every data frame**, no
  matter how many values were interpolated. The data-frame branch never set
  the field, and the fallback below it is `%||% 0L` -- so unlike the other
  unset fields, which default to `NA` and claim nothing, this one asserted
  that nothing had been imputed. A map-ready frame carrying two interpolated
  values reported zero of them, in the function whose whole job is reporting
  provenance. `n_imputed` is a data-side fact and is now computed from the
  frame; the plot path is unchanged.

* **`imputed_count()` picked an arbitrary row per country.** It counts once
  per country, because a map draws one polygon per country, but it did so via
  `distinct(.keep_all = TRUE)` -- the *first* row. Identical on the map-ready
  cross-section it is documented for, but on a panel the first row is an
  arbitrary year, so a value interpolated in any other year counted as nothing
  imputed at all. Now "imputed in any row for this country".

* **Running `interpolate_missing()` twice turned the imputation flag off**,
  which the documented hard rule says cannot happen. The flag was recomputed
  from scratch on each call as "was `NA` before, is not now" -- and after the
  first call the filled cells are no longer `NA`, so every `TRUE` became
  `FALSE`. `world_map()` reads that column to avoid drawing imputed values as
  though they were observed, so a second defensive call -- or a re-run
  notebook cell -- silently produced a map with no provenance caption.
  "This value was imputed" is a property of the data, not of the call that
  produced it, so an existing logical flag is now carried forward and the
  operation is idempotent. Carried as a column rather than a vector, because
  the pipeline re-sorts by `iso3c` and `year`. A flag column that is *not*
  logical is somebody else's, and still warns that it is being overwritten.

* **One infinite value silently voided a whole `z_score` column.** `scale()`
  drops `NA` but runs an infinity straight through the mean and the SD, so a
  single `Inf` made every `z_score` in `rank_countries()` `NaN` -- beside a
  `rank` and a `percentile` that were still correct, because both are
  rank-based and untroubled by an infinity. That is the easiest kind of
  corruption to miss. `z_score` is now `NA` with a warning saying which two
  columns are unaffected.

* **`sigma_convergence()` returned a silent `NaN` for a year containing an
  infinity**, through the same `!is.na()` filter that `beta_convergence()`
  had: `Inf` passes both the `NA` test and `> 0`, so it reached
  `sd(log(x))`. The filter now tests `is.finite()`, and the reported `n`
  already says how many observations survived.

* **An infinite base year made `index_to()` report a country as having
  collapsed to zero.** The guard already returned `NA` for a base that was
  missing, `NA` or `0`, but not for one that was infinite -- so every other
  year of that country became `finite / Inf`, a plain and entirely plausible
  `0`, while its neighbours indexed correctly. The guard now tests
  `!is.finite()`, which covers `NA` and `NaN` exactly as before.

* **An infinite value crashed `beta_convergence()` with a base R error.** The
  filter kept observations that were `!is.na()` and `> 0`, and `Inf` passes
  both, so an infinity reached `log()` and `lm()` died with *NA/NaN/Inf in
  'x'* -- unclassed, naming nothing. `gini()` and `theil()` already treat an
  infinity as unusable; the filter now tests `is.finite()`, dropping it
  alongside the `NA` and non-positive values it already dropped.

* **A character `year` broke the verbs that do arithmetic on it, each in a
  different way.** `read.csv()` yields `"2000"` readily, and most verbs here
  tolerate it because they only sort or group. The four that actually compute
  with a year did not: `beta_convergence()` died with base R's *non-numeric
  argument to binary operator*, `growth_rate(type = "cagr")` surfaced a dplyr
  mutate error quoting an internal expression, and `deflate()` exposed its
  internal join as *Can't join `x$year` with `y$year`*. All three now use the
  same guard `complete_years()` already used, so the message names the column
  and the conversion. `growth_rate(type = "yoy")` is unaffected -- it never
  does year arithmetic -- and neither are `lag_by_country()`, `index_to()`,
  `sigma_convergence()` or `convergence_club()`.

* **`locate_country()` crashed on an `NA` coordinate and went quiet on an
  out-of-range one.** A missing longitude or latitude -- what a failed
  geocoding step produces all the time -- reached `sf::st_as_sf()` and came
  back as base R's *missing values in coordinates not allowed*, an unclassed
  error naming neither argument. Those rows now return `NA`, which is already
  the documented way this function says "no country here", and the rest of the
  points are located as usual. Separately, a longitude outside [-180, 180] or
  a latitude outside [-90, 90] returned a silent `NA`, indistinguishable from
  open ocean, so a column still in 0-360 degrees -- or with the two swapped --
  looked like a world of water rather than a mistake; it is now a classed
  error naming the offending pairs and the conversion.

* **A gap in `year` made `lag_by_country()`, `diff_by_country()` and
  `growth_rate(type = "yoy")` compare rows that are years apart, silently.**
  These read the previous *row*, not the previous year, so on a panel of 2000,
  2002 and 2005 the 2005 growth rate came back as 27.3% -- the change since
  2002 -- in a column the docs call year-on-year and the argument calls
  `"yoy"`. The arithmetic is unchanged, because a quinquennial panel is a
  legitimate design and re-keying the lag would move everyone's results; but
  the three verbs now warn and name the countries whose years are not
  consecutive, pointing at `complete_years()`. `type = "cagr"` divides by the
  real year span and so is silent, as before.

* **`convergence_club()` died with a bare `simpleError` on a repeated
  country-year.** `pivot_wider()` folds the repeat into a list-column and
  `as.matrix()` then failed with base R's *invalid 'type' (list) of argument*,
  naming neither the verb nor the offending rows. A repeat is fatal to the
  log-t test rather than merely inaccurate, so it is now a classed error that
  lists the country-years and points at `check_panel_unique()`.

* **`theil()` returned `NaN` for both components when one group's weights
  summed to zero.** `sw == 0` was guarded for the whole vector, but not per
  group: the group mean `sum(w[i] * x[i]) / swg` was `0/0`, and the `NaN`
  poisoned `between` and `within` while `total` came back a perfectly good
  number -- with no warning to say which group did it. A group with no weight
  has no share of the population, so its contribution to both components is
  exactly zero, and the decomposition identity `total == between + within`
  now holds in that case too.

* **`interpolate_missing()` stripped a column's class when, and only when, the
  series had a gap.** The fill went through `ifelse()`, which drops attributes,
  so a `Date` column came back as bare numbers -- `2020-01-01` returned as
  `18262`. A series with no `NA` took an early return that preserved the
  column, so the same column changed type depending on its data. The fill now
  assigns into a copy of the input, which keeps the class.

* **Passing ISO codes to a verb that expects country names gave no usable
  advice.** `origin` defaults to `"country.name"` throughout, so
  `country_factsheet("FRA")` -- the canonical ISO3 code -- was refused and the
  message suggested `check_country_match()`, which has nothing to say about a
  code. When every unresolved value is a valid code under some other origin,
  the message now names it: *It resolves under `origin = "iso3c"` -- try that
  instead.* Applies to `country_factsheet()`, `neighbors()`,
  `distance_between()` and the join verbs. A genuinely unknown name still gets
  the close-name suggestion and no misleading hint.

* **Accented country names written in NFD resolved to `NA`.** The same accent
  can be encoded as one precomposed code point (NFC) or as a base letter
  followed by a combining mark (NFD) -- identical on screen, different strings
  to `match()`. countrycode's tables are NFC, so `"Turkiye"`, `"Sao Tome and
  Principe"`, `"Aland Islands"`, `"Curacao"` and `"Reunion"` in their accented
  NFD spellings matched nothing, silently, even in a UTF-8 locale -- which is
  precisely where `?country_overrides` promises accented names do work. macOS
  returns NFD for filenames and several export paths emit it, so this is input
  a user gets without choosing it. `Cote d'Ivoire` was unaffected and hid the
  problem: countrycode's regex for it keys on an ASCII substring that
  decomposition leaves alone. Names that resolve to nothing are now retried
  with their combining marks stripped, which turns an NFD spelling into the
  ASCII spelling the package already documents as resolving in any locale.
  Only the unresolved values are retried, so the pass can add a match but
  never move one: across the 314 names the package and countrycode ship, none
  changed.

* The README said `common_indicators` "keeps the 20 you actually use" after
  this release grew it to 22 with the two price-conversion series. Corrected,
  and the count is now asserted against `nrow(common_indicators)` so the
  prose cannot drift from the data again.

* **The global `getis_ord(local = FALSE)` gave the same answer for a variable
  and its negation.** The general G is a ratio of weighted to total
  cross-products, so every `x_i * x_j` term survives negating the whole
  variable: `g(x)` and `g(-x)` came back as bit-for-bit the same double, and
  the statistic could not tell a coldspot pattern from a hotspot one. Getis &
  Ord (1992) define it for a variable with a natural origin and no negative
  values, and `gini()` -- the nearest analogue here, a global index with a
  positivity domain -- already warns and returns `NA` in this case. The global
  branch now does the same, naming how many values are negative, instead of
  handing back a plausible-looking number computed outside its domain. Zero is
  still allowed, positive columns are numerically unchanged, and the local
  `Gi*` branch standardises and is untouched.

* **`growth_rate(type = "cagr")` returned a bare `NaN` for a negative value,
  silently.** The compound rate is `(v_t / v_0)^(1/n) - 1`, and the code
  guarded `v_0 > 0` -- the base of the ratio -- but not `v_t`. A fractional
  power of a negative ratio is `NaN`, so a single negative year in an
  otherwise positive series put a `NaN` in the column with nothing said. Every
  neighbouring measure reports this: `theil()` drops non-positive values and
  says how many, `gini()` warns about negatives, `sigma_convergence()` warns
  when no value is positive, `beta_convergence()` errors, and `growth_rate()`
  itself warns when *every* row comes back `NA`. The partial case was the one
  silent spot, and it is the case real data hits -- a deficit or a net flow
  dipping below zero for a single year. Negative values now give `NA` with a
  `countryatlas_cagr_negative` warning naming how many rows are affected. A
  value of exactly `0` is unaffected and still gives `-1`, an annualised
  -100%, which is the right answer for a series that went to nothing;
  `type = "yoy"` is a plain ratio change, is defined for negatives, and is
  untouched.

* `index_to()` documents what it does when `base_year` is not in the data. A
  country whose series does not cover the base year indexes to `NA` rather
  than stopping the call, because the rebasing is per country and a partial
  answer is still a real one -- so a `base_year` no row anywhere carries
  (including any non-integer value, which no year can equal) gives an all-`NA`
  column rather than an error. That was pinned by a test and explained in a
  code comment, but nothing in `?index_to` said it, and the sibling
  `deflate()` refuses such a year instead. Both behaviours are unchanged; the
  contrast is now stated, with an example.

* **A `units` value crashed the numeric guards.** `sf`'s `st_area()` and
  `st_distance()` return units objects, so a threshold computed from geometry
  and passed to a numeric argument is an easy mistake -- and `is.numeric()` is
  TRUE for one, so it sailed through the type check. The *range comparison*
  then raised the units package's own "both operands of the expression should
  be units objects", naming neither the argument nor this package.
  `check_number()` and `check_top_n()` now ask whether the comparison is
  possible before making it, and say what to do: "`cutoff_km` must be a plain
  number. Got <units> ... Drop the unit first, e.g. `as.numeric(cutoff_km)`."
  A classed numeric that does compare, and a named scalar, are still accepted
  as before.

* **Three more arguments consumed a function before checking it.** A sibling
  of the validator fix below, with a different mechanism: the value was used
  before any check ran, so the crash came from the consuming call rather than
  the message. `check_choice()` reached `as.character(x)` on its
  default-detection line, which is how `world_map(projection = mean)` died;
  `country_groups()` reached `setdiff(group, valid)`, which coerces (and a
  formula got as far as "duplicated() applies only to vectors"); and
  `complete_years()` called `anyNA(years)` *inside the condition* of the guard
  meant to catch bad input, which errors outright on an environment. All three
  now refuse a function or environment up front and name the class.

* **Passing a function to a validated argument crashed the validator itself.**
  `check_string()`, `check_bool()`, `check_number()` and `check_top_n()` build
  their message with `{.val {x}}`, which coerces the value to character -- and
  that fails outright for a closure, with base R's "cannot coerce type
  'closure' to vector of type 'character'". The error path therefore crashed
  instead of reporting the bad input, and every caller inherited it:
  `register_country_source(mean, ...)`, `clear_country_cache(source = mean)`,
  `as_ggsql_source(name = mean)` and `world_query(source = mean)` all gave a
  bare `simpleError` from base R rather than naming the argument. `length()`
  was no defence -- a closure has length 1, so the length branch never fired,
  and `length(globalenv())` counts bindings, so an environment reported "Got 5
  values". All four now name the class instead: "Got `<function>`". Ordinary
  values, including the value itself and the wrong-length counts, are
  unchanged.

* **A numeric argument turned an "unknown name" error into a cli crash.**
  Several messages put the pluralisation marker ahead of the value --
  `"Unknown group{?s}: {.val {bad}}"`. With no quantity set, cli reaches for
  the most recent interpolation to find one, and a *numeric* vector there is
  read as the quantity itself, which must be length 1. So
  `country_groups(c(1, 2))` died on cli's own "length(object) == 1 is not
  TRUE" rather than reporting the bad input, and the same held for
  `check_cols()`, `world_table(columns = )` and
  `classify_compare(methods = )`. Character vectors were fine, which is why it
  went unnoticed. The five affected messages now set the count with
  `cli::qty(length(x))`, the form `reporting.R` already used. Note `qty(x)`
  alone is not enough for a numeric `x` -- it hits the same trap. Singular and
  plural now read correctly for both types, and character messages are
  unchanged.

* **The spherical-area helper mis-measured rings at the antimeridian.**
  `ring_area_km2()` picks a country's largest polygon piece so the label lands
  on the mainland rather than in an ocean. Longitudes arrive wrapped into
  `[-180, 180)`, so a raw edge difference jumps by ~360 degrees at the
  antimeridian, and the two failure modes pointed opposite ways: a ring
  *crossing* 180 measured 179 times too large (a 2-degree equatorial square
  came out at 8.85e6 km2 instead of 49447), while one *encircling* the pole
  cancelled to about zero (a cap at latitude -80 measured 7e-11 instead of
  3.87e6). Either can hand the "largest piece" choice to the wrong ring --
  exactly the mislabelling the helper exists to prevent. Edges are now
  differenced modulo 360, which agrees with the analytic area for an
  equatorial square, a wrapped square and a polar cap alike. No centroid
  changes: the bundled polygon data splits pieces at the antimeridian, so all
  239 still match `country_meta`. The point is that the result no longer
  depends on the data being split that way.

* **`tissot_map()` failed for many ordinary radii.** Its circles are built by
  walking out along azimuths `0..2*pi` and wrapping longitude into
  `[-180, 180)`. `az = 0` and `az = 2*pi` are the same point, but the wrap
  could send the two ends to `-180` and `+180` -- the same meridian, opposite
  signs -- so `st_polygon()` saw an unclosed ring and sf reported "polygons
  not (all) closed", a bare `simpleError` naming neither the argument nor the
  function. Whether it happened depended on the radius, and the default hid
  it: at `radius_km = 500` no centre in the grid produced such a ring, at
  `1000` six did and at `5000` fifteen. The failures were not monotonic --
  `500` and `10000` worked while `1000`, `2000`, `5000`, `8000`, `12000` and
  `20000` did not. The ring is now closed by construction rather than relying
  on the arithmetic to reproduce its first vertex, and every radius from 100
  to 40000 km draws. The antimeridian guard is unchanged, so a larger radius
  still drops the circles that would smear across the map.

* **An enormous `k` in `dorling_map()` surfaced a GEOS exception.** `k` was
  bounded below but not above. `check_number()` already refuses `Inf`, so
  `k = Inf` errored cleanly, but a merely enormous finite value passed and
  then overflowed the coordinate arithmetic inside GEOS, which reported an
  illegal-argument exception about encountering non-finite numbers in an
  orientation test -- a bare `simpleError` from a C++ library, naming neither
  `k` nor the function. It is now capped at `.Machine$integer.max`, the bound
  the counting arguments elsewhere use, so the refusal comes from the package
  and names the argument. Realistic values are unaffected: `k = 1e6` still
  draws.

* **`top_n` past integer range leaked a base R error.** `Inf` is the
  documented "no limit", and `world_table()` and `country_network()` both gate
  on `is.finite(top_n)` to detect it -- so a *finite* value beyond integer
  range passed the gate and then broke on the coercion behind it.
  `as.integer(1e18)` is `NA`, so `utils::head(df, NA)` surfaced base R's
  "invalid 'n' - must contain at least one non-missing element, got none": a
  bare `simpleError` naming neither `top_n` nor the package. Asking for at
  most `1e18` rows of a 191-row table is the same request as `Inf`, so it is
  now normalised to `Inf` rather than rejected. Representable limits are
  unchanged, `.Machine$integer.max` still works, and `0` / negatives / `NA` /
  non-numeric are still refused with a `countryatlas_error`. Found by fuzzing
  argument values, looking for errors the package had not classified.

* The two hand-curated datasets are pinned to the scripts that build them.
  `country_groups_history` and `disputed_territories` are maintained by hand
  in `data-raw/`, so the script is the source of truth and drift can happen in
  either direction -- editing the `.rda` without the script, or the script
  without rebuilding. Both are now re-run during the tests and compared to the
  shipped data, the same guard `data-raw/overrides_snapshot.R` already had.
  Both reproduce byte for byte today.

* `interpolate_missing()` no longer carries a second, unreachable
  duplicate-column guard. `check_panel_unique()` grew one of its own earlier
  in this cycle, and it runs five lines earlier, so the copy inside
  `interpolate_missing()` could never fire -- its stale comment still claimed
  the function "did not" reject duplicate names. Line coverage showed the
  block never executing. The rejection itself is unchanged, still raising
  `countryatlas_duplicate_columns`, and is now covered by a test.

* `audit_time_coverage()`'s three console messages are covered by tests. None
  of those lines had ever executed, which meant the pluralisation in
  "{n} row{?s} fall{?s/} outside the country's existence" had never been
  checked at both counts -- and `{?s}` keys to the most recently interpolated
  value, a construct this package has got wrong before. Both readings are
  correct ("1 row falls", "2 rows fall") and are now pinned, along with the
  no-findings message and the empty-input column contract.

* **`rate_check()` reported "no countries flagged" when it meant "unknown".**
  When no small-denominator threshold can be computed it warns that `flagged`
  is `NA` throughout -- but `is.finite(den) & den < thr` yields `FALSE`, not
  `NA`, for a non-finite denominator, because R short-circuits `FALSE & NA` to
  `FALSE`. An all-`NA` denominator therefore produced `FALSE` for every row,
  so `sum(out$flagged)` returned `0`: a confident "nothing is flagged", which
  is precisely the misreading the warning was written to prevent. An all-zero
  or all-negative denominator did yield `NA`, so the cases disagreed with each
  other as well as with the message. With no threshold, no row can be compared
  to one, so `flagged` is now `NA` for every row and the warning fires exactly
  when that is true. The normal path is unchanged, including its `FALSE` for a
  missing denominator among usable ones, which keeps `sum(out$flagged)`
  working as intended.

* **`getis_ord()` computed its spread with the unstable one-pass formula, so
  a tightly clustered column produced `Inf` or `NaN` z-scores.** The spread
  was `sqrt(sum(x^2)/n - mean(x)^2)`, which subtracts two nearly equal large
  numbers and loses every significant digit once the mean dwarfs the
  variation. Measured on 8-country vectors: `1e9 + 1:8` drove the spread to
  exactly `0`, so the denominator was `0` and every `z_score` came back `Inf`
  with `p_value` `0` -- reading as "every country is a significant hotspot";
  `1e10 + 1:8` gave a spread 90 times too large, so nothing was ever
  significant; and `1e12 + 10 * 1:8` went negative under the `sqrt`, returning
  `NaN` z-scores and leaking base R's warning about them. The
  zero-variance guard caught none of it, because such a column is not
  constant, only nearly so. Centring before squaring is algebraically the same
  quantity and unconditionally stable, and it is how `local_morans()` already
  computed its second moment. Well-conditioned columns are unaffected to
  floating-point noise. Gi* z-scores are shift and scale invariant by
  construction, which is what the old form violated, so that invariant is now
  asserted rather than any particular number.

* **A trailing space on `region` silently drew an empty map.**
  `resolve_region()` trimmed in its `iso3c` branch and nowhere else, so one
  trailing space gave three different answers: `"FRA "` resolved, `"Europe "`
  fell through to country-name matching and errored, and `"EU "` was accepted
  as a three-letter code -- `nchar("EU ")` is 3 and it is already uppercase,
  so it reached the branch that passes an unrecognised code through untouched
  and came back as the literal string `"EU "`. Every public caller of that
  helper -- `world_geometry()`, `world_data()`, `attach_geometry()`,
  `join_world()` and `country_borders()` -- therefore subset to nothing and
  reported nothing, which is the outcome that branch exists to prevent. Every branch now reads the same trimmed value, so
  all 15 shipped groups, the continents, codes and names agree across padding.
  The error message still quotes the caller's value untrimmed.

* **Padding was tolerated for a code but not for an overridden spelling, and
  a non-breaking space defeated the trim entirely.** `trimws()`'s default
  class is `[ \t\r\n]`, so the `iso3c` branch's deliberate trim missed every
  non-ASCII space -- `"FRA "` resolved and `"FRA\u00a0"`, what a code pasted
  from a web table or a Word document carries, did not. Separately the
  override lookup keyed on the raw value while the whitelist was built from
  the trimmed one, so with `custom_match = c(Somaliland = "SOM")`,
  `"Somaliland"` gave `SOM` and `"Somaliland "` gave `NA`; an ordinary
  trailing space was enough. Both now use one Unicode-aware trim. A BOM or a
  zero-width space is a format character rather than whitespace and is still
  rejected rather than silently accepted.

* **`top_n` went unvalidated in `world_table()` and `country_network()`.**
  `Inf` is the documented "no limit", which `check_number()` rejects, so the
  guard was a bare `is.finite()` -- and everything `is.finite()` rejects then
  skipped validation altogether. `top_n = "5"` and `top_n = NA` silently
  returned every row instead of five, and `top_n = NULL` failed on `if` with R's
  "argument is of length zero". Both now validate up front and still take `Inf`.
* **`world_table(subtitle = )` was dropped unless a `title` came with it.** gt
  draws the subtitle inside the header block that a title opens, so a lone
  subtitle had nowhere to go; it now says so instead of vanishing.
* **`value_by_alpha_map()` drew a half-lit map when opacity meant nothing.**
  The alpha scale had no `limits`, so it rescaled to whatever spread the frame
  happened to have; an `equalize` column with nothing usable collapsed to one
  value and ggplot2 placed it at the *midpoint* of `alpha_range`. The result
  read as "every country equally weighted" -- the one impression this verb
  exists to prevent. Opacity is now absolute (`limits = c(0, 1)`), so a frame
  with no usable equalising variable is drawn at the floor and says so, and two
  maps of different subsets are comparable.
* **`rate_check()` returned an all-`NA` `flagged` column in silence.** With no
  positive finite denominator anywhere, the tenth-percentile threshold is `NA`
  and every comparison against it is `NA` too -- so `sum(out$flagged)`, the
  obvious next step, came back `NA` rather than a count. It now says why.
* **`deflate()` returned an all-`NA` country without saying why.** A country
  with no usable deflator in `base_year` has nothing to rebase against, so every
  one of its values is `NA` -- correct arithmetic, but in the output
  indistinguishable from a country the source never covered. It now names them
  and suggests a base year the panel actually spans.
* **`od_map()` dropped a named origin without saying so.** A country that
  appears in the OD table only as a destination has no outflow to draw, so it
  was filtered out -- silently, leaving the caller to notice that they asked for
  four panels and got three. Named origins now warn (and point at
  `direction = "in"`); trimming the `origins = <n>` top-N list stays quiet,
  which is what top-N means.
* **`distance_between()` returned a silent `NA` for a name that is not a
  country.** Two causes produce an `NA` distance and only one is the documented
  gap: a country with no bundled centroid is expected -- `?distance_between`
  says so, and `country_weights()` already reports it -- while a value that
  resolves to no country at all is a mistake, usually the wrong `origin`, and
  handed back a column of `NA` with nothing said. The second is now reported,
  naming the values and the `origin` in force; the documented gap stays quiet.
* **`simplify_geometry()` and `theme_world_map()` never validated their first
  argument.** Both check their *second* one carefully.
  `simplify_geometry()` handed a non-spatial object straight to rmapshaper,
  leaking "no applicable method for 'ms_simplify' applied to an object of class
  NULL" -- rmapshaper's generic rather than the argument -- and failed
  differently again through the `sf::st_simplify()` fallback, so the message
  depended on which optional package the caller happened to have.
  `theme_world_map()` got base R's bare "non-numeric argument to binary
  operator". Found by calling all 102 exports with degenerate input and
  classifying which errors were the package's own.
* **Three verbs joined on an unstandardised key and said nothing.** Lowercase,
  mixed-case and padded `iso3c` values match nothing, so `attach_geometry()`
  drew every country as no-data, `tile_map()` drew every tile grey, and
  `add_indicator()` attached a column of pure `NA` -- each of which reads as a
  coverage problem, or as the provider having no data, rather than as a key
  problem. An *unmatched* code stays quiet, because the basemap genuinely holds
  fewer countries than the snapshot; matching *nothing* now says so and points
  at `standardize_country()`, which normalises case and whitespace.
  `attach_geometry(year = )` already reported its match rate; the ordinary
  branches did not.
* **`complete_years()` also leaked one on a *missing* `year`.** It infers the
  span with `seq(min(year), max(year))`, so a single `NA` produced base R's
  "'from' must be a finite number", naming neither the column nor the package.
  The `years` argument has been checked for `NA` all along; the column it
  defaults from had not, and one blank cell in a CSV is enough to hit it.
* **`complete_years()` leaked an internal error on a non-numeric `year`.** Its
  `years` *argument* was checked carefully but the `year` *column* was not, so a
  character one surfaced as dplyr's "Can't join `x$year` with `y$year` due to
  incompatible types" -- naming dplyr's internals rather than the column -- and
  a factor got base R's bare "'min' not meaningful for factors". Both come
  straight out of a CSV read.
* **`country_factsheet()` printed `NA` as the country name** for any code with
  no `country_meta` row. The fallback was `first_or_na(row$country) %||% iso`,
  but `%||%` only replaces `NULL` and `first_or_na()` returns `NA_character_`,
  so it never fired: `country_factsheet("Kosovo")` headed its output
  `NA (XKX)` while listing four real land neighbours underneath. It now falls
  back to the name the caller used.
* **`country_meta` had five blank capitals alongside 34 `NA`s.**
  `WDI_data` uses `""` for an unknown capital and it passed through
  unchanged, so `is.na(capital)` was wrong for Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Israel,
  Macao and the Palestinian Territories, and the factsheet printed
  `capital: ` with nothing after it. Blank strings are now `NA`, in the
  dataset and in the script that builds it.
* **`Suggests: testthat` understated its minimum.** The suite has used
  `expect_no_error()` (testthat 3.1.5) for some time and now uses
  `expect_no_match()` (3.2.0), while `DESCRIPTION` still asked only for 3.0.0.
  Bumped to `>= 3.2.0`.
* **`rank_countries()` and `share_of_world()` said nothing about a repeated
  country-year.** `interpolate_missing()` and `complete_years()` already report
  that shape, but the two verbs that *aggregate across* rows did not -- and
  their output is the harder to reconcile. Given a frame with `USA`-2020
  duplicated, `rank_countries()` returned the same country holding ranks 1
  **and** 3, and `share_of_world()` gave it shares of 0.1 and 0.7 against a
  world total that counted it twice. Both now report it, each naming its own
  consequence rather than the lag family's.
* **Four numeric-column verbs did not check that the column was numeric.**
  `country_network()` validates its `weight` with `check_numeric_col()`; the
  verbs shaped like it did not. `bubble_map()` and `flow_map()` reached
  ggplot2's bare `Discrete value supplied to a continuous scale`, and only at
  *build* time -- so the call returned happily and the failure surfaced when
  the plot was printed, naming neither the argument nor the column.
  `spike_map()` blamed the join (`No rows with a non-negative <col> joined to a
  centroid`) and `convergence_club()` blamed the panel (`Not enough countries
  with a complete series`), when in both cases the column simply was not a
  number. All four now refuse at the call, naming the column.
* **`fetch_indicator()` trusted a registered source's `key_col` claim.** When
  a source declared `key_col = "iso3c"` its codes were used verbatim, but the
  declaration is the source's claim rather than a guarantee -- and this is the
  package's public extension point. Lowercase codes (`"usa"`) passed through
  unchanged, a factor stayed a factor, and numeric UN M49 codes (`840`) sailed
  through as numbers, each producing rows that silently joined to nothing and
  read as "the provider has no data". The key is now standardised whatever the
  source claims (a no-op on codes that are already right), and values that are
  not usable as the declared key become `NA` *and* are named
  (`countryatlas_bad_key`).
* **A factor value column was read as its level indices.** `adapter_reshape()`
  coerced the provider's value column with `as.numeric()`, which on a factor
  returns level *indices*: a column of `factor("10", "20")` became `1, 2`.
  `check_numeric_col()` rejects a factor outright with precisely this advice
  (`as.numeric(as.character(x))`), and its comment notes how easily such a
  column happens -- but the adapters take theirs from a third party, so they
  cannot reject it and must not misread it either.
* **Every source path misread the provider's time column.** `...` forwards to the client, so the caller chooses its type:
  eurostat's `time_format = "num"` returns a numeric year and `"raw"` a
  character one, while the default is a `Date`. Each adapter assumed one shape.
  `fetch_eurostat()` failed on the other two with base R's opaque
  `invalid 'trim' argument` -- `format()` reading `"%Y"` as its `trim`
  argument. `fetch_oecd()` was worse, failing *silently*: `as.integer()` on a
  `Date` returned **18262**, the day count, as the year, and a quarterly
  `"2020-Q1"` became `NA`. Both now read the year from a date, a number, or a
  string leading with one, and say so when a value is not a year at all.

  The same bare `as.integer()` reached six sites, not two: `fetch_comtrade()`,
  whose `period` is `YYYYMM` for monthly data (so `"202001"` became the year
  202001); `adapter_reshape()` itself, which `fetch_owid()` reaches without
  preprocessing; and `fetch_indicator()` -- the *public extension point*, where
  the year is whatever a third-party fetch function returned. All six now share
  one reader.

  Two more sites outside the adapters took a year from the caller and read it
  the same wrong way. `audit_time_coverage()` turned a `Date` year column into
  day counts (`1990-01-01` -> 7305) and then flagged *both* USSR rows as
  post-dissolution -- silently wrong output from the one verb whose job is
  catching that class of mistake. And `deflate()` reported a `Date` `base_year`
  back as `` `base_year` 11323 is not in year ``, a number the caller never
  supplied; it now accepts a date, a number or a string, and names what it was
  actually given when it cannot.
* **The source adapters returned an empty frame in silence when no entity
  resolved.** `adapter_reshape()` resolves the provider's entity column with
  `suppressWarnings()` on purpose -- every Our World in Data or Eurostat
  response carries aggregate rows like `"World"` and `"EU27"` that are not
  countries and never resolve -- but that also swallowed a provider renaming
  its entities, or the wrong column being named. The result was zero rows and
  no explanation, sending the reader to check their own indicator code, while
  the same function takes care to explain an empty *input* a few lines earlier.
  Nothing resolving at all now aborts (`countryatlas_no_entities`), naming the
  entities it could not match. An empty result from the `countries`/`years`
  filters is unaffected -- those entities did resolve.
* **`bivariate_map()` leaked `classInt`'s "single unique value"** for a column
  with no variation. `classInt` needs two distinct values per axis to cut
  classes from, and a constant column reached it as a bare `simpleError` from a
  third-party package, naming neither the column nor the function nor anything
  to do about it. Both axes are now checked, naming the column and its distinct
  count.
* **`tile_map()` overstated its coverage**, the same way `bubble_map()` and
  `spike_map()` did. The bundled equal-area grid does not cover every code --
  Hong Kong and Macao have snapshot data and no tile -- so counting the input's
  coded countries as shown claimed 191 where the map could draw 189. Coverage
  is now measured against what the grid can actually place, and the
  `countryatlas_no_centroid` warning names the countries it cannot.
* **`per_capita()` returned `Inf` for a zero population, silently.**
  `deflate()` and `to_ppp()` were fixed for precisely this -- there is a test
  named *"an unusable deflator or PPP factor gives NA, not Inf"* whose comment
  records that `Inf` "propagated silently into every scale and summary
  downstream" -- but the most used function of the family never got the fix. A
  zero or missing population now yields `NA` and says so, matching its
  siblings. A *negative* population still passes through unchanged and
  silently, because that is pinned deliberately elsewhere in the suite --
  negative values are the caller's business and the arithmetic stays honest.
* **`country_weights()` built an edgeless graph without comment.**
  `country_weights("distance", cutoff_km = 1)` returned 239 countries and zero
  links, as did an all-zero custom matrix. Every statistic then refused to run
  with `Not enough connected countries with data` -- an error about the *data*,
  raised far from the `cutoff_km` or matrix that actually caused it. Building
  weights that link nothing now warns (`countryatlas_empty_weights`), naming
  the cause specific to the scheme.
* **`smooth_rates()` and `to_ppp()` returned all-`NA` columns in silence** --
  the same bug `rate_check()` already had fixed, kept by its two siblings. With
  no finite positive denominator every rate is `NA` and the smoothed column
  with it; with no finite positive conversion factor every converted value is
  `NA`. Correct arithmetic either way, but the output looked like a computation
  that had run rather than one with nothing to run on. Both now say so, and
  report a partial loss with a count.
* **`country_weights("custom")` validated only the row and column names**, so
  bad input leaked a bare base-R error from deep downstream instead of being
  refused where the caller could act. A character matrix reached `rowSums()` as
  `'x' must be numeric`; an `NA` entry was *accepted*, then killed any statistic
  built on it with `subscript out of bounds`; an `NA` endpoint in a long frame
  surfaced as `NAs are not allowed in subscripted assignments`; and an `NA`
  weight was accepted outright, silently turning every result into `NA`. All
  four are now refused at construction, naming the argument and the count.
  Numeric and logical matrices and long frames are unaffected -- and this is the
  path `vignette("honest-maps")` recommends for a non-geographic adjacency
  (trade volume, migration, shared language).
* **One `dplyr::filter()` referenced its columns bare.** The bounding-box
  branch of `world_geometry(geometry = "polygon")` filtered on `long`/`lat`
  rather than `.data$long`/`.data$lat` -- the only such site against twenty
  `.data$` uses elsewhere. A bare reference falls back to a variable of that
  name in the calling scope when the column is absent, so it can filter on the
  wrong thing where `.data$` errors plainly. With it converted,
  `utils::globalVariables()` no longer needs to declare `long` and `lat`;
  only `animate_world()`'s NSE default `time = year` remains.
* **`spin_globe()`'s example was never executed by anything.** It sat in
  `\dontrun{}`, which `R CMD check` skips even under `--run-donttest`, so the
  one example of the GIF pipeline was free to rot unnoticed. It needs no
  network -- only bundled data and `gifski`/`magick` -- so it is now
  `\donttest{}`, guarded on those packages and cut to six frames, which runs
  in about five seconds and is checked from here on.
* **`as_ggsql_source(format = "duckdb")` did not say who owns the connection
  it returns.** duckdb keeps its in-memory database alive until the handle is
  released, and neither `@return` nor `@param format` told the caller to close
  it -- while the `"parquet"` branch quietly closed the connection it opened.
  `?as_ggsql_source` now spells out all three lifecycles, and a connection the
  function opened itself is released if the write throws, so a failure cannot
  leave a handle nobody holds.
* **`sigma_convergence()` returned an empty or blank series in silence.** Its
  positive-value filter is documented -- `n` counts what survived -- but two of
  its outcomes were not. A column with no positive values came back as a 0-row
  tibble, and a year with a single country got `sigma = NA` from `sd()`, so an
  empty or blank convergence series was indistinguishable from a real one. Both
  now warn (`countryatlas_no_positive`, `countryatlas_thin_year`), the latter
  naming the years affected. An ordinary panel is unchanged and silent.
* **`gini()` and `theil()` returned `NA` without saying why.** Both carried a
  comment stating the package convention -- "NA plus a word about why (as for
  zero weights)" -- while the line beneath returned `NA` in silence for exactly
  those cases. An all-zero column and all-zero weights were indistinguishable
  from a missing input. Both now warn (`countryatlas_undefined_index`) naming
  which it was. Perfect equality still returns `0`, silently, because that is
  a value and not an undefined one.
* **A constant column made the spatial statistics return `NaN` in silence.**
  `morans_i()`, `gearys_c()`, `local_morans()` and `getis_ord()` all divide by
  the cross-sectional variance, so a column with no variation between countries
  is 0/0 -- and `getis_ord()`'s z-score came back `Inf` where the numerator was
  non-zero. For a statistic that is worse than an error, because it reads like
  a computed result. All four now warn
  (`countryatlas_zero_variance`), explaining that these measures compare
  variation between neighbours and there is none, and return `NA` rather than
  `NaN`. An all-zero column also stops `getis_ord()` dividing `gi_star` by its
  own zero sum. Real data is unaffected.
* **`map_provenance()` gained `n_total`.** `n_countries` holds the countries
  actually drawn *with a value* -- the numerator -- but the name reads like the
  map's country total, which is `n_countries + n_missing`. Anyone taking it as
  the denominator understated their own coverage. The denominator is now a
  field of its own, and the three counts are spelled out in `?map_provenance`.
* **The coverage caption did not pluralise.** `footnote = "auto"` is built
  with `sprintf()` and lands on a published map, where a single-country frame
  read `All 1 countries shown.` and an empty one `All 0 countries shown.` The
  same noun appears in `coverage_map()`'s caption and `map_provenance()`'s
  print block. All three now agree with the count, an empty frame says
  `No countries to show.`, and a frame with no coverage to report gets no
  caption rather than one full of `NA`.
* **`spatial_lag()` gave every year of a panel the first year's neighbour
  average.** It is the one spatial verb that returns a column aligned to the
  caller's own rows, and it matched on `iso3c` alone. France's
  `gdp_per_capita` ran 39,683 -> 158,734 -> 277,784 across three years while
  `gdp_per_capita_lag` sat at 63,409 for all of them, so `value / lag` --
  the Moran-scatterplot axis this column exists for -- silently compared 2002
  against 2000. A panel now gets a lag computed per year; a cross-section is
  unchanged.
* **The spatial statistics silently computed on an arbitrary year of a
  panel.** `align_weights()` -- shared by `morans_i()`, `gearys_c()`,
  `getis_ord()`, `local_morans()`, `spatial_lag()` and `lisa_map()` -- reduced
  to one row per country with a bare `distinct(iso3c, .keep_all = TRUE)`, so a
  panel collapsed to whichever row came first in the frame. Moran's I on the
  same data returned 0.47 or 0.29 depending only on row order, and unlike the
  map verbs these said nothing at all about having chosen. They now go through
  the shared reduction: the earliest year, deterministically, with the
  `countryatlas_panel` warning. A genuine cross-section is unaffected.
* **"Only the earliest year of each country is used" was not true.** The
  one-row-per-country reduction behind `rate_check()`, `audit_coverage()`,
  `correlate_indicators()`, `world_table()` and every map verb warned that it
  keeps the earliest year, but the code was
  `distinct(iso3c, .keep_all = TRUE)`, which keeps whichever row comes *first
  in the frame*. That is the earliest year only for a caller who happened to
  sort by year: shuffle the same panel and `rate_check()` returned a different
  numerator for France (20 sorted, 30 shuffled) and the map verbs drew a
  different year, while the warning went on promising "earliest" either way.
  The earliest year is now selected explicitly, so these verbs are
  reproducible for a given frame regardless of row order, and the survivors
  keep their original relative order.
* **`standardize_country()` silently destroyed columns the caller never asked
  about.** `add` defaults to `c("iso3c", "iso2c", "continent", "region")`, so
  the ordinary call -- `standardize_country(d, country)`, to get `iso3c` --
  also replaced any `continent`, `region` or `iso2c` already in the frame. A
  user's own regional classification vanished without a word, while the eleven
  other column-adding verbs all report this through `warn_overwrite()`. It now
  warns (`countryatlas_unasked_overwrite`) naming the columns, *only* when
  `add` was left at its default: passing `add` yourself still means you asked
  for those columns, as documented. `add = "iso3c"` adds just the code.
* **`country_join()` silently multiplied rows when standardising collapsed two
  names onto one code.** `wdj_to_key()` maps distinct inputs to the same code --
  `"France"` and `"FRANCE "`, or `"Congo"` and `"Congo-Kinshasa"` -- so a `y`
  whose names all looked distinct could join one country twice. dplyr says
  nothing: with unique keys on the other side that is an ordinary one-to-many,
  not the many-to-many it flags. Two rows became three, France appeared twice
  with different values, and a downstream `sum()` double-counted it. Both
  `country_join()` and `country_join_all()` now warn
  (`countryatlas_key_collapse`), naming the code and the inputs that collapsed
  onto it. Only a *collapse* is reported: duplicates already present in the
  input under one name, and country-by-year panels, are legitimate one-to-many
  joins and stay silent. `warn = FALSE` silences it.
* **Subnational maps counted countries instead of regions, and binned on
  them too.** `na_coverage()`, `classification_table()`, `apply_binned_fill()`
  and `imputed_count()` de-duplicate before counting -- the polygon backend
  repeats a country's value down every vertex -- but keyed on `iso3c`. A
  subnational frame carries `iso3c` *as well as* a region code, so every NUTS
  region of a country collapsed to one row: a 280-region map reported
  "27 of 27"; because `distinct()` keeps the first row per key, blank regions
  inside a country whose first region had data were reported as **zero
  missing**, claiming complete coverage of a map with visible holes; and the
  quantile breaks were computed from 27 values rather than 280, so the colour
  scale itself was wrong. All four now key on the most specific unit column
  present (`nuts_id`, then `iso_3166_2`, then `iso3c`, then `group`).
* **`country_borders()` silently omits five whole countries at its default
  scale, and `country_factsheet()` reported the resulting short count as
  fact.** Adjacency comes from Natural Earth, and the default `scale = "small"`
  (110m) has no polygon at all for Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino
  or the Vatican -- countries for which a land border is the entire geography.
  They contributed no rows, so each reported zero neighbours and France
  reported 8 instead of 10, under a heading stating the count as fact.
  `?country_borders` now has a *Which countries the default leaves out*
  section naming them and pointing at `scale = "medium"` (which has all five),
  and `country_factsheet()` names what its count excludes -- only for the
  countries actually affected. (The Brazil and Suriname borders it reports for
  France are real, via French Guiana.)
* **Passing something that is not a column to a column argument leaked a raw
  rlang error.** `quo_arg_name()` called `rlang::as_name()` directly, so
  `world_map(data, 5)` failed with `Can't convert a double vector to a string.`
  and `world_map(data, gdp_per_capita + 1)` -- a natural thing to try -- with
  `Can't convert a call to a string.` Neither named the argument, the function,
  or what was expected, and the leak reached every one of the package's ~66
  unquoted column arguments. The error now names the argument and the offending
  expression, and suggests the fix: compute the column first for an expression,
  drop the pronoun for `.data$x`, or pass a bare name or string for a literal.
* **`world_table(value = NULL)` labelled an unsorted slice with a `rank`
  column.** With nothing to rank on, the frame keeps whatever order it arrived
  in and `top_n` takes an arbitrary slice -- but the result was still numbered
  1..n under a heading that told the reader these were the top n by something.
  `world_table(world_snapshot$countries, top_n = 5)` presented Afghanistan as
  "rank 1" next to an empty GDP cell. The column is now added only when a
  `value` was given, and truncating an unsorted table warns.
* **A failed World Bank download was cached to disk as if it had succeeded.**
  `WDI::WDI()` answers a failed request by warning and returning a zero-row
  frame; memoise cached that, and the World Bank cache is persistent -- so one
  call made while the network was down poisoned every later session until
  someone ran `clear_wdi_cache(disk = TRUE)` by hand. An empty response is now
  never cached, and says why (`countryatlas_no_data`).
* **`register_country_source(cache = )` did nothing.** The flag was stored in
  the registry and reported by `country_sources()`, but nothing ever read it:
  the documented per-session memoisation never happened, and `cache = FALSE`
  was equally inert. Results are now memoised per source, keyed on the
  indicator, countries, years and any extra arguments, and cleared by
  `clear_country_cache(source = )`. Empty results are not memoised.
* **`world_map(engine = "tmap")` could not draw in its default style.**
  `tm_scale_intervals()` is tmap's *interval* scale, and `"cont"`/`"cat"` are
  not interval styles -- they name different constructors. So the default
  `style = "continuous"` failed outright with tmap's `Invalid style. Style
  should be one of "fixed", "sd", "equal", "pretty", ...`, and
  `style = "categorical"` warned that an interval scale was being applied to
  non-numeric data. Each style now reaches the constructor tmap has for it.
* **`flow_map()` drew every trans-Pacific flow across the whole map.** A great
  circle Tokyo -> Los Angeles has longitudes running `...178, 179, -179,
  -178...`, and `geom_path()` under `coord_quickmap()` joined those two points
  literally, so the arc streaked back across Africa instead of crossing the
  ocean. Arcs are now split at the antimeridian and land exactly on the edge.
* **`flow_map()` titled its legends `weight`** whatever the caller's weight
  column was called, because the internal arc frame's column is literally named
  `weight`. Both scales now carry the real name -- which also merges what were
  two legends of the same variable into one.
* **`geom_country_labels(mapping = )` could only name four columns, and
  cancelled `flag = TRUE`.** The centroid reduction returned
  `iso3c`/`long`/`lat`/`flag` and dropped the rest, so
  `aes(colour = continent)` -- the ordinary reason to pass a mapping -- died on
  "object 'continent' not found". Separately, the caller's mapping *replaced*
  the defaults instead of adding to them, so supplying one removed the `label`
  aesthetic entirely and silently ignored `flag`.
* **`animate_world(title = )` was discarded.** The frame marker was written
  straight into `title`, overwriting anything passed through `...` to
  `world_map()`. The title now stays and the frame label moves to the subtitle.
* **`style = "binned"` ignored `n_bins`.** It was passed to ggplot2 as
  `n.breaks`, which is only a hint -- `scales::extended_breaks()` snaps to round
  numbers -- so `n_bins = 5`, `6` and `7` all drew five bins and `3` drew four.
  `world_map()`, `globe_map()` and `value_by_alpha_map()` now compute explicit
  equal-interval boundaries, so `n_bins` means the same thing under `"binned"`,
  `"quantile"` and `"jenks"` as documented -- and in every verb that takes it,
  not just `world_map()`. `globe_map()` and `value_by_alpha_map()` also record
  the boundaries in provenance, which only `world_map()` did before.
* **`classification_report = TRUE` fabricated classes for continuous fills.**
  With no break vector the report fell back to one row per distinct *value*: a
  continuous choropleth of GDP per capita produced a 189-row table of `n = 1`
  that looked like a classification and described nothing. A continuous
  colourbar now reports `NULL` and warns (`countryatlas_no_classes`); `"binned"`
  gets a real table, because it now has real breaks.
* **`bubble_map()` and `spike_map()` failed on data already carrying
  `centroid_lon`/`centroid_lat`** -- including `world_geometry("centroids")`'s
  own output. dplyr suffixed both sides of the join to `.x`/`.y` and the `aes()`
  referring to `centroid_lon` then found no such column. The incoming columns
  are dropped in favour of the bundled ones.
* **`bubble_map()` and `spike_map()` overstated their coverage.** Both join the
  bundled centroid table, which does not cover every code in the codelist. The
  five countries with snapshot data and no centroid -- Hong Kong, Macao,
  Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands and Tuvalu -- were dropped at draw time
  (`bubble_map()` left-joined and let ggplot2 mutter "Removed 5 rows";
  `spike_map()` inner-joined and said nothing), but provenance was computed on
  the frame as it arrived. A population map that never drew Hong Kong reported
  "215 of 215" with `n_missing = 0`. Coverage is now measured against what is
  actually placed, and a new `countryatlas_no_centroid` warning names the
  countries that could not be.
* **`na_style = "hatched"` and `disputes = "mark"` silently discarded the
  projection.** `ggpattern::geom_sf_pattern()` and the `geom_sf()` inside the
  dispute layer each return `list(<layer>, <CoordSf>)` -- a default
  `coord_sf(crs = NULL)` -- and ggplot2 replaces the plot's coordinate system
  unconditionally when a coord is added. Both layers go on after
  `wdj_coord_sf()`, so they threw away the requested CRS and its latitude clip:
  `world_map(projection = "mercator", na_style = "hatched")` and the same call
  with `projection = "robinson"` drew byte-identical maps. Two honesty features
  quietly reprojecting the map is the opposite of the point.
* **`clear_wdi_cache(disk = FALSE)` deleted the on-disk cache, and any other
  file beside it.** memoise's `cache_filesystem()$reset()` is
  `file.remove(list.files(dir, full.names = TRUE))`, so `forget()` on a
  disk-backed memo was never an in-memory operation -- the call the examples
  label "forget the in-session memo" wiped the persistent cache and every
  unrelated file that happened to share the directory. The `disk` flag gated
  nothing on the way in; it only decided whether the directory was additionally
  removed. Dropping the memo reference is what an in-session clear means here,
  and the next fetch reads the existing entries straight back.
* **`years` meant something different for the World Bank than for every other
  source.** It is documented as a numeric year *vector*, and the four adapters
  honour that, but the WDI path used only `min()`/`max()` as a request range and
  never filtered the result -- so `years = c(2000, 2020)` asked for two years
  and got twenty-one.
* **A mistyped `classify` silently added no classification columns.**
  `world_data()` and `country_data()` filtered the argument with `intersect()`,
  so `classify = "incomes"` matched nothing and quietly produced a frame with no
  income, continent or region column rather than saying the value was not
  recognised. `language` went straight to WDI, where a length-2 value surfaced
  as "the condition has length > 1". Both are now checked before the network
  call, so the error does not depend on having a connection.
* **A mistyped `region` drew an empty map in silence.** `region` accepts a
  continent, a group name, `iso3c` codes, country names or a bounding box, and
  anything matching none of those fell through to name-matching, resolved to
  `NA`, and produced an empty subset -- so `region = "Europ"` returned a blank
  map with no explanation, and `region = NA` reached the internal tests as base
  R's "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed". Both are now reported. An
  explicitly-uppercase unknown code still yields an empty subset, which is
  deliberate and documented in the code.
* **`add` reported its problems under somebody else's argument.**
  `standardize_country(add = )` and `locate_country(add = )` name attributes to
  derive from `iso3c`, and neither validated the argument: an unknown name
  surfaced as countrycode's complaint about its `destination` argument, a bad
  one in `locate_country()` as `convert_country()`'s `to`, and `add = NA` as
  base R's bare "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed". Both now check it, and
  the shortcut table they accept is shared with the validator so the two cannot
  drift apart.
* **A malformed `custom_match` could put a non-code in `iso3c`.** `origin` was
  validated and the override table was not, although every value in it lands in
  the `iso3c` column -- and the `iso3c` branch whitelists those values as valid
  by construction, so nothing downstream rejected them either.
  `custom_match = c(Freedonia = 1)` therefore produced `iso3c == "1"`, and every
  join, geometry lookup and group test after it keyed on that. The table must
  now be the name-to-code map `country_overrides()` returns.
* **`wdi_search()` searched for whatever it was given.** Only `field` was
  checked, so a non-string `pattern` went straight into the regex and matched
  something plausible: `wdi_search(1)` returned 10,125 indicators and
  `wdi_search(NA)` the entire 29,495-row catalogue, both without complaint,
  while an empty one leaked base R's "invalid 'pattern' argument". A `cache`
  that was not a `WDIcache()` object died on "$ operator is invalid for atomic
  vectors". Both are now checked.
* **`spin_globe(file = )` was the one argument its validation block missed**,
  so a non-string path leaked base R's "invalid 'path' argument" from inside the
  writer -- the block's own comment says a bad argument is the caller's bug and
  the message should not depend on which optional packages are installed.
* **`audit_coverage()`'s group breakdown measured one indicator and did not
  say which.** `by_group$na_rate` is computed on the first indicator -- with the
  default that is whichever numeric column comes first -- while the printed
  heading reads "Coverage by group", so a region's GDP coverage of 0.25 read as
  its overall coverage even though population and life expectancy were complete.
  The table now carries an `indicator` column naming what was measured.
* **`compare_sources()` could report two providers as agreeing perfectly when
  it had never compared them.** An unnamed `indicator` of more than one code was
  silently truncated to its first element and broadcast to every source, so the
  verb compared a code against itself and found no disagreement. Its own error
  message elsewhere already told callers to "pass a single unnamed code";
  nothing enforced it. Now rejected, with a pointer to the named form.
* **`deflate()` overwrote an existing column in silence.** `to_ppp()` and
  `smooth_rates()` are the same shape -- take a panel, write one derived column
  back into it -- and both announce a clash before destroying the caller's
  column. `deflate()` did not, so a frame that already carried `gdp_real` lost
  it without a word.
* **A repeated country-year made `interpolate_missing()` rewrite observed
  values.** `stats::approx()` collapses tied x-values to their mean, so two rows
  sharing a year were both overwritten with the average -- 20 and 999 became
  509.5 apiece -- and the `_imputed` flag reported `FALSE` for them, since it
  compares "was `NA`" against "is not `NA`" and neither ever was. The safeguard
  the code documents, that a filler changing an observed value shows up as a
  flagged cell, cannot catch this case. The malformed input is now reported, and
  `approx()`'s own tie notice -- which reached the caller as an uninformative
  "There was 1 warning in `dplyr::mutate()`" -- no longer leaks.
* **A repeated country-year corrupted every verb that reads across rows.**
  `lag_by_country()`, `diff_by_country()`, `growth_rate()`, `index_to()`,
  `complete_years()`, `deflate()`, `to_ppp()`, `convergence_club()` and
  `beta_convergence()` all read neighbouring rows, so a duplicated
  country-year silently shifted them: with France's 2019 present twice as 20
  and 999, 2020 was lagged against 999, giving a difference of 979 and 4895%
  growth. The malformed input is now reported, and it names the offending key.
* **The one-row-per-country verbs collapsed a panel silently.**
  `world_table()`, `rate_check()`, `audit_coverage()`, `gridded_cartogram()`,
  `bubble_map()`, `spike_map()`, `globe_map()`, `interactive_map()`,
  `tile_map()` and `correlate_indicators()` reduce to one row per country -- which is for repeated *geometry* rows, not for time.
  Handed a panel they kept whichever row sorted first and presented that year as
  the answer: France's 2018 value of 10, out of 10, 20 and 30. They now say so.
  `tile_map()` was worse than silent -- its grid holds exactly one cell per
  country, so a panel fanned 239 cells out into 659 overlapping ones.
* **A panel handed to `world_map()` was drawn silently.** `attach_geometry()`
  joins a panel deliberately -- `facet_map()` and `animate_world()` are built on
  it -- so a multi-year frame reaching a single static map drew each country
  once per year and let whichever row came last win, with a caption that still
  counted each country once, so nothing looked wrong. `world_map()` now says so
  and points at the two verbs meant for a panel. Faceting *by* year and
  `animate_world()` resolve the panel and stay quiet; faceting by anything else
  does not -- each panel still stacks every year -- so there it still warns.
* **Three counts lacked the upper bound their coercion needs.**
  `world_query(n_bins = )`, `od_map(origins = )` and
  `convergence_club(min_size = )` validated only a lower bound, then coerced
  with `as.integer()` -- which past 2^31-1 returns `NA` with R's bare "NAs
  introduced by coercion to integer range". The query came out reading
  `BIN fill INTO NA`, `od_map()` reached `seq_len(NA)`, and every size
  comparison in `convergence_club()` became `NA`. `compute_breaks()` has carried
  this bound since 2.0.0; these three now do too.
* **`subnational_map()` dropped unmatched regions in silence.** Its join keeps
  the geometry and discards data rows that match none of it, so codes from a
  different NUTS vintage simply vanished -- and only a *total* join failure was
  reported, even though that error names the vintage problem exactly. Partial
  mismatches are now named too.
* **`check_country_match()` suggested a country for a blank cell.** The guard
  skipped `NA` and `""` but not `"  "`, and Jaro-Winkler finds spurious
  similarity between a two-space string and a name containing spaces -- so a
  whitespace-only cell, the commonest thing a CSV import produces, came back
  confidently suggesting "Congo - Kinshasa" at a distance of 0.29, well inside
  the threshold.
* `audit_coverage()`'s `n_missing` and `na_rate` are no longer named vectors.
  `vapply()` names its result after `indicator`, so `a$na_rates$na_rate` handed
  back `c(gdp = 0.1)` instead of `0.1` -- the same wart `country_network()`
  already calls `unname()` on.
* **Three verbs folded every uncoded country into a single row.** The
  de-duplication that stops a polygon frame counting a country once per vertex
  ran `distinct()` on `iso3c`, and `distinct()` treats `NA` as a value -- so
  countries the codelist could not resolve collapsed together.
  `audit_coverage()`, the verb the package points at for "which countries are
  missing", named one unmatched country out of four and divided every `na_rate`
  by a short `n`; `rate_check()` and `world_table()` quietly returned three rows
  for a five-row input. Coded rows are still collapsed; uncoded ones now
  de-duplicate on whatever else identifies them.
* **`country_join()` and `country_join_all()` never reported a failed
  reconciliation.** Reconciling both sides to a common key before joining is
  the entire premise of these two verbs, yet a name that resolved to no country
  was dropped in silence -- `join_world()` has warned about this all along, and
  `wdj_to_key()` only speaks up when a name resolves to `iso3c` but has no
  COW/GW code, which on the default `key = "iso3c"` is never. Both now name the
  unresolved values, per side and per table, and both take `warn = FALSE` to
  opt out.
* **`aggregate_regions(fun = "weighted_mean")` returned `NaN` for a zero total
  weight.** The unweighted branch turns an empty group into `NA` precisely
  because `0`, `NaN` and `+/-Inf` all read as real figures for a region there is
  no data for; the weighted branch checked only for missing values, so weights
  that were all zero -- or that cancelled -- divided by zero and leaked the
  `NaN` the documentation promises never to produce.
* **`add_indicator()` suffixed the column it said it was overwriting.** When
  the fetched indicator shared a name with a column already in `data`, the
  warning read "Overwriting ... rename them first to keep the original values"
  while the `left_join` underneath produced `val.x` and `val.y` -- so the caller
  got neither the column they asked for nor the one they had, advised by a
  message describing a mechanism that was not running. It now overwrites, as
  every other `warn_overwrite()` caller does.
* **An uncoded geometry row was counted as a country.** The bundled `sf`
  basemap carries one row with no `iso3c`; coverage counted it, so it sat in
  the denominator and in `n_missing` while `missing_iso3c` -- which sorts, and
  so drops `NA` -- listed one fewer. `footnote = "auto"` read "159 of 176
  countries shown; 17 missing" where provenance could name only 16 of them.
  Coverage now counts coded countries only, and the two agree.
* **`gridded_cartogram()` did the same, and mentioned only half of it.** It
  drops countries with no positive value and countries with no bundled
  centroid; only the second was ever reported, and provenance counted the
  survivors, so a grid covering 94 of 215 countries reported "94 of 94". It now
  names both drops and keeps the whole input as the denominator.
* **A cartogram reported the world it kept, not the one it started from.**
  `cartogram_map()` and `dorling_map()` drop every country without a positive
  weight -- necessarily, since a cartogram's area *is* the weight -- but they
  did it silently, and provenance was then computed on the survivors, so
  `n_total` shrank to match. A map showing 69 of 175 countries reported
  "69 of 73". Coverage is now measured against the frame as it arrived, and the
  countries that could not be sized are named.
* **`bivariate_map()` overstated its coverage the same way.** It classifies two
  variables jointly, so a country holding only one is drawn as no-data -- but
  provenance counted the x column alone. On a half-covered second variable it
  reported 159 countries shown where 69 were coloured. It now counts both, and
  names what it dropped.
* **A VSUP map overstated its own coverage.** `world_map(uncertainty = )`
  colours a country only where it has *both* a value and an uncertainty, but
  coverage was counted from missing fill values alone. On a frame whose
  uncertainty column was sparser than its value column -- an uncertainty join
  that half missed, say -- `footnote = "auto"` reported 159 of 175 countries
  shown when 69 were actually drawn, and `map_provenance()` agreed with it. The
  footnote that exists to stop a map overstating what it covers was doing
  exactly that. Coverage now counts both columns, and the countries dropped for
  a missing uncertainty are named.
* **`interpolate_missing()` flagged the wrong rows as imputed.** The
  "was missing" vectors were captured from the input and compared against the
  output, but the pipeline between them arranges by `iso3c` and `year` -- so the
  two lined up only when the caller happened to pass an already-sorted frame.
  On anything else the `_imputed` flags landed on entirely different rows,
  marking observed values as imputed and imputed ones as observed. Since
  `world_map()` reads that column to write its caption, an unsorted panel
  produced a map that misreported exactly which countries had been filled in.
  The flags now travel with their rows.
* **`flow_matrix(fill = )` corrupted the flows it was meant to leave alone.**
  `fill` is documented as the value for pairs with *no* flow, but the matrix was
  initialised to it and the observed weights accumulated on top, so `fill = -1`
  turned a flow of 10 into 9 -- and `symmetric = TRUE` then added the fill to
  itself. Flows are now accumulated into zero and `fill` is applied only to
  pairs no flow ever reached. The default `fill = 0` is unaffected.
* **`compare_sources()` reported disagreement between the wrong sources.** Every
  column of the pairwise summary is computed for its own pair except
  `n_disagree`, which read the row-wise spread across *all* sources: comparing
  three providers, a pair that agreed exactly was still counted as disagreeing
  wherever some third provider was the outlier. A source that reports one value
  for every country also leaked `cor()`'s "standard deviation is zero" warning;
  the correlation is `NA` either way, so the case is now decided explicitly.
* **`fetch_comtrade()` fetched only the first indicator.** It read
  `indicator[[1]]` and ignored the rest, so a two-commodity call quietly
  returned one column -- against the documented "one column per indicator" that
  its three sibling adapters honour. It now makes one request per commodity and
  joins them.
* **The source adapters validate `indicator` before doing anything else.**
  Called directly with an empty vector, `fetch_owid()`, `fetch_eurostat()` and
  `fetch_oecd()` returned a silent `NULL`, and `fetch_comtrade()` leaked
  comtradr's "subscript out of bounds". All four now give the same message
  `fetch_indicator()` always gave, and give it whether or not the provider's
  client package is installed.
* **A provider that changes shape is named as such.** `adapter_reshape()`
  checked the entity column but not the value column, although `fetch_eurostat()`
  hard-codes `"values"` and `fetch_oecd()` guesses between two spellings; a
  missing one became `as.numeric(NULL)` and surfaced as a recycling error
  several frames away. `fetch_comtrade()`'s year column had the same gap.
* **`country_sources()` no longer writes to your home directory.** It reported
  which of the five backing packages were installed by calling
  `requireNamespace()` on each, which *loads* them -- and `comtradr` creates
  `~/.cache/R/comtradr` in its `.onLoad`. Merely asking which sources were
  available therefore created a directory in the user's file space, which CRAN
  policy forbids and `R CMD check` reports as a new file in another directory.
  Availability is now tested with `system.file()`, which does not load.

Five defects found by auditing 2.0.1; three produced a wrong or unusable
picture rather than an error.

* **`cartogram_map()`, `dorling_map()` and `tile_map()` rejected a categorical
  `fill`.** All three hard-wired `scale_fill_viridis_c()`, so a discrete fill
  column -- which their `fill` argument documents no restriction on -- was
  accepted at the call and then died at *print* time with ggplot2's bare
  "Discrete value supplied to a continuous scale". The scale is now chosen from
  the column's type, as `world_map()` has done since 2.0.0.
* **`geom_country_labels(data = ...)` was unusable**: `data` was hard-wired in
  the layer call while `...` was documented as passing to that same call, so the
  ordinary idiom for labelling a subset failed on R's `formal argument "data"
  matched by multiple actual arguments`.
* **`world_map(projection = "mercator")` produced an unusable map.** Natural
  Earth's Antarctica reaches -90 degrees, where Mercator's *y* goes to infinity;
  PROJ clamps rather than erroring, so the panel came out three times taller
  than the world is wide, with the inhabited world a sliver above one grey
  rectangle of smeared Antarctica. Mercator is now clipped to +/-85.05113
  degrees, as Web Mercator has been since it was defined.
* **`locate_country(points = )` leaked an sf internal** ("no applicable method
  for 'st_transform'") for anything that was not already `sf`. A plain lon/lat
  frame is the commonest thing to pass, so it now gets a named error saying how
  to convert it.
* **`morans_i()` could not reveal what it had dropped** -- see below.
* **A wrong coding scheme died inside `countrycode`.** `origin` is user-facing
  on seventeen exported functions -- `neighbors()`, `country_join()`,
  `standardize_country()`, `flow_map()`, `country_timeline()`, `in_group()` and
  the rest -- and was validated only as "a string". Anything else reached
  `countrycode::countrycode()` and failed there, so `origin = "country"` raised
  a forty-item list of accepted values attributed to an argument the caller had
  never passed. Invalid schemes now raise a `countryatlas` error naming the one
  they probably meant: `"country"` and `"name"` both suggest `"country.name"`,
  `"iso3"` and `"ISO3C"` suggest `"iso3c"`.
* **`convert_country()`'s own `from` and `to` were the two that guard missed.**
  Every scheme other than `"country.name"` and `"iso3c"` skips the `iso3c` hop,
  so `from` reaches `countrycode()` directly and was still blamed on `origin`;
  and `to` was never checked at all, so a typo produced "the `destination`
  argument must be ... one of the column names in the conversion directory" --
  an argument, and a directory, the caller never mentioned. Both now name
  themselves and suggest the nearest real value, so `to = "contnent"` offers
  `"continent"`. The shortcut destinations (`flag`, `currency`, `tld`,
  `calling_code`, `name_fr`-style localised names) are unaffected.
* **`register_country_source(key_col = )` was used as a coding scheme.**
  `key_col` names the column `fetch` returns, and is documented and indexed as
  such -- but it was also handed to `countrycode()` as `origin`, so the only
  registrations that worked were those whose column happened to be named after
  a scheme. Every bundled source uses the `"iso3c"` default, which
  short-circuits before `countrycode()` is reached, so nothing in the package
  exercised it and the first source registered with `key_col = "country"` died.
  How to *read* the column is now its own argument, `key_type` (default
  `"iso3c"`), validated at registration and reported by `country_sources()`.
* **"5 countries ... has no cowc code."** The COW / Gleditsch-Ward key
  warning interpolates which table it refers to *between* the count and the
  verb, and cli keys an agreement marker to the most recent interpolated
  value -- a length-1 string here -- so the verb stayed singular however many
  countries were lost. `cli::qty()` now re-keys it to the count. (Only
  literal markup such as `{.field iso3c}` is safe to sit between a count and
  its agreement.)
* **`world_map(engine = "tmap")` ignored most of its arguments.** The engine
  received all of `world_map()`'s arguments and used ten of them, dropping the
  rest in silence: `projection` and `recenter` (so the documented default,
  Equal Earth, was dropped just as quietly as an explicit request), plus
  `na_style`, `footnote`, `classification_report`, `uncertainty` and
  `disputes`. `projection` and `recenter` are now honoured -- `wdj_crs()`
  resolves both and `tm_shape()` takes the result, which also means a bad
  projection name is finally rejected instead of ignored. The remainder are
  genuinely ggplot2-specific, so they are now named
  (`countryatlas_engine_ignored`) rather than quietly not happening.
* **`globe_map(interactive = TRUE)` accepted styling it could not use, and
  validated nothing.** The hand-off to MapLibre returned before
  `arg_match()` and `check_label_args()` ran, so `style = "nonsense"` and a
  length-3 `title` were taken without a murmur, and `style`, `palette`,
  `n_bins`, `borders`, `title`, `legend`, `na_label` and `backend` were all
  dropped. The arguments are now validated before the hand-off, and the ones
  MapLibre cannot carry are named.
* **`world_map(engine = "tmap")` ignored `na_label`.** The argument was
  passed into the tmap backend and never used, so a caller who named the
  missing-data key got tmap's own default instead, with nothing to indicate
  the label had been dropped -- while the ggplot2 engine honoured it. Every
  tmap scale takes `label.na`, so it is now passed through, and both engines
  share one normalisation of what the argument means (first element; a
  length-1 `NA` or `NULL` leaves the engine's own formatter alone).
* **`projection` was accepted and silently ignored by the polygon backend.**
  It is documented for the `sf` backend, and `recenter` already warned when it
  could not be honoured, but `projection` did not: the polygon backend returns
  unprojected longitude/latitude, so `projection = "mollweide"` looked
  honoured and changed nothing. It now warns
  (`countryatlas_projection_ignored`). `world_data(geometry = "none")` fetches
  no geometry at all and so warns for `scale`, `projection` and `recenter`
  alike, where before it took all three and dropped them.
* **`world_data(region = ..., geometry = "none")` returned every country in
  the world.** `region` is documented as a plain "Optional subset", but it was
  only ever applied inside `attach_geometry()` -- which the `"none"` branch
  skips -- so the argument was dropped in silence and a request for one
  continent came back with all of them. It now subsets the table directly. A
  bounding-box `region` has nothing to clip against without geometry, so that
  combination is refused rather than guessed at.
* **A `scale` of more than one value produced an error from base R.** The
  sf backend builds its cache key with `paste0("scale_", scale)` *before*
  validating, so a length-2 value vectorised into a two-element key and `[[`
  on an environment failed with "wrong arguments for subsetting an
  environment" -- naming neither the argument nor the package. A typo, a
  number, `NA` and `NULL` all reached the real check and reported properly;
  only the multi-value case escaped it. `scale` is now checked before it
  becomes a key. Affects `country_borders()`, `neighbors()`, `morans_i()`,
  `world_geometry(geometry = "sf")` and everything else routed through
  `get_world_sf()`.
* **`scale` was accepted and silently ignored by the polygon backend.**
  It selects a Natural Earth resolution, which only the sf backend fetches;
  the bundled polygons come at one resolution. `world_geometry(scale =
  "large")` and `attach_geometry(scale = "large")` therefore returned small
  polygons as though the request had been honoured, and `scale = 2` was not
  even rejected. Both now warn (`countryatlas_scale_ignored`) and point at
  `geometry = "sf"`, matching the existing notice for `recenter`.
* **`cartogram_diagnostics()` leaked the geometry engine's error.** One
  invalid ring makes s2 refuse `st_area()` with "Loop 0 is not valid: Edge 0
  crosses edge 2", which names neither the country nor the package. It now
  reports which geometries are invalid and points at `sf::st_make_valid()`.
  Unlike `country_borders()`, it cannot simply fall back to the planar GEOS
  engine: an area is the number this function reports, so switching engines
  would quietly change the answer.
* **`complete_years()` gave every year it invented an empty geometry.** The
  function exists so "animations do not flicker on missing years", but on an
  `sf` panel it produced exactly that: `tidyr::complete()` fills an invented
  row's geometry with an *empty* geometry rather than `NA`, so the
  `tidyr::fill()` that carries static columns forward saw nothing missing and
  skipped it, and the completed years rendered blank. Each country's own shape
  is now carried across its invented rows.
* **`complete_years()` also dropped the `sf` class.** `tidyr::complete()`
  returns a plain tibble while leaving the geometry column intact, so the
  result still held a live `sfc` column that `geom_sf()` and `st_bbox()` would
  not accept until the caller re-ran `st_as_sf()`. Fifteen other
  frame-returning verbs preserve `sf`; this one now does too.
* **`interactive_map()` discarded `...` for two of its five engines, one of
  them against its own documentation.** `@param ...` promised the dots reach
  `world_map()` for the `"plotly"` *and* `"ggiraph"` engines -- but the
  `"ggiraph"` branch assembles its own ggplot instead of calling
  `world_map()`, as a comment in it says, so
  `interactive_map(engine = "ggiraph", style = "quantile")` returned a default
  continuous map with no hint that the classification had been dropped. The
  `"leaflet"` engine builds its own map too and was not documented at all,
  and `"mapgl"` forwards to `mapgl::maplibre()`, which was also undocumented.
  Both self-assembling engines now name what they were given, the `@param`
  says where the dots actually go for each of the five, and `"plotly"` still
  forwards them (so an unknown argument is still an error there).
* **`world_table(engine = "tibble")` dropped `title` and `subtitle` in
  silence.** A tibble has no header, so neither can be drawn -- but the `gt`
  path already refuses to drop a subtitle quietly ("`subtitle` needs a
  `title`"), and the same objection applies here: the caller got back a table
  they believed was titled. Both are now named, and when `gt` is simply not
  installed the notice points at installing it rather than at an engine the
  session cannot reach.
* **`index_to()` with no `base_year` gave base R's error.** Omitting the
  argument reached `check_number()` and produced 'argument "base_year" is
  missing, with no default'. `deflate()`, the sibling with the same argument,
  has said "`base_year` is required." since 2.0.0.
* **`disputed_territories$administered_by` and `$claimed_by` mixed ISO codes
  with placeholders, and said nothing about it.** The columns read as `iso3c`
  and mostly are, but six parties are entities ISO assigns no code to and are
  written as `ABK`, `CYP-N`, `OST`, `PMR`, `SAH` and `SOL` -- so treating the
  column as ISO-keyed produced silent `NA`s in a package whose premise is that
  ISO codes are the join key. The `iso3c` column had always documented its own
  `NA` convention; these two now document theirs -- including that five of the
  six administer the like-named territory (which has no ISO code either) while
  `SAH` is a claimant only, of a territory ISO does code (`ESH`) -- and a test
  pins the exact set so it cannot drift or absorb a typo.
* **Three more character column arguments died on base R's "object not
  found".** `aggregate_regions(by = region)`, `world_table(columns = gdp)` and
  `country_codes(codes = iso3c)` all take column names as *strings* while
  sitting next to an argument that takes a bare column, which makes the slip
  an easy one -- and it failed while the argument was being evaluated, before
  any validation could run, so the message named neither the argument nor the
  package. `complete_years()`, `interpolate_missing()` and `audit_coverage()`
  already caught it; these three now do too. (`rank_countries(within = )`
  deliberately accepts either form and is unchanged.)
* **A repeated column name was ambiguous everywhere but one verb.** What
  `read.csv(check.names = FALSE)` gives you for a sheet with two `gdp` columns
  makes every by-name reference ambiguous. `interpolate_missing()` refused it;
  nothing else did. Ten verbs leaked the tibble error "Column name `gdp` must
  not be duplicated. Use `.name_repair` to specify repair" -- a message about
  internals in tibble, not about the caller's data -- and two, `per_capita()`
  and
  `to_ppp()`, silently succeeded: they computed from whichever column `[[`
  reached first and dropped the other without a word. The guard now lives in
  the validators every verb already calls (`check_cols()`,
  `check_panel_cols()`, `check_panel_unique()`), and in the two functions that
  reach `as_tibble()` before validating anything
  (`countryatlas_duplicate_columns`).
* **`rank_countries()` returned a `data.frame` where its siblings return a
  tibble.** It ended in `dplyr::ungroup()`, which strips a grouping but does
  not normalise a class -- and because it deliberately ungroups its input
  first, `mutate()` left a plain frame plain. Four sibling verbs ended the
  same way and were safe only because `group_by()` had already made their
  intermediate a tibble; all five now state the contract explicitly.
* **Four verbs leaked an incoming grouping.** `to_ppp()`, `smooth_rates()`,
  `interpolate_missing()` and `spatial_lag()` ended in a bare `data`, so they
  returned whatever class arrived: a grouped frame stayed grouped and the
  caller's next `mutate()` silently computed per group, and a plain
  `data.frame` never became a tibble. Their sibling verbs all normalise on the
  way out. The leak also hid on early-return paths of otherwise-fixed verbs --
  `smooth_rates(method = "none")`, `interpolate_missing(method = "none")` and
  both branches of `spatial_lag()` -- so a mode of the same function returned
  a different class from its default.
* **`join_world(region = ..., geometry = "none")` returned every row**, for
  exactly the reason `world_data()` did: the `"none"` branch returned before
  any of the geometry arguments were applied, though `region` is documented as
  a plain region subset. It now subsets, refuses a bounding box that has
  nothing to clip against, and warns for `scale`, `projection` and `recenter`.
* **`standardize_subnational()` never consulted the `regions` crosswalk, and
  did not say so.** It looks for a `geo_name`, `name` or `region_name` column
  in `regions::nuts_lau_2019` or `regions::all_valid_nuts_codes`. As of
  `regions` 0.1.8 the first exposes `lau_name_national` and `lau_name_latin`,
  and the second has no name column at all -- so neither matched, the lookup
  was skipped, and the caller was told only that their regions "did not
  resolve", with a hint about European coverage that had never been consulted.
  It now reports once per session that the installed `regions` offers no
  crosswalk it can use, so the real reason is visible. The behaviour is
  otherwise unchanged, deliberately: the `regions` datasets that *do* pair
  names with codes (`nuts_changes`, `google_nuts_matchtable`) key NUTS codes
  such as `DE2` rather than ISO 3166-2 codes such as `DE-BY`, and filling an
  `iso_3166_2` column from them would break this function's promise that an
  unresolved region gets `NA`, never a guess.
* **Four messages read wrongly when they described exactly one thing.**
  `subnational_map()` said "1 value ... match no geometry and are dropped",
  `check_dispute_coverage()` said "1 have no ISO code" and "1 ... territories
  appear", and `gridded_cartogram()` said "there are 1 countries to place".
  Each now agrees with its own count. `cli` keys a `{?...}` agreement to the
  most recent interpolated number, so the count and every agreement have to sit
  together -- an interpolation in between silently re-keys them, which is why
  the totals in two of these messages moved to the end of the sentence.
* **An unreachable GISCO reported itself as an `sf` method error.**
  `giscoR::gisco_get_nuts()` answers a failed download with `NULL` rather than
  an error -- the same shape as `owidR`'s blank result, which `fetch_owid()`
  names explicitly and for exactly this reason. `nuts_geometry()` had no such
  guard, so the `NULL` reached `sf` as "no applicable method for `st_as_sf`
  applied to an object of class NULL", which says nothing about GISCO being
  unreachable and sends the reader to check their arguments. An empty response
  now says so, naming the level and vintage. A response carrying no `NUTS_ID`
  column is diagnosed too: previously the derived `iso3c` came back
  zero-length and base R failed with "replacement has 0 rows, data has 2".
* **A changed World Bank response shape was reported as a failed download.**
  `countrycode()` is handed `raw$iso2c` directly to derive `iso3c`, so a
  response carrying neither key raised its own "sourcevar must be a character
  or numeric vector" -- which the fetch wrapper then relabelled "Could not
  fetch indicator … from the World Bank API". That blames the network for a
  change in the provider's response, and attaches advice about an argument the
  caller never passed. The response shape is now diagnosed by name, listing the
  columns that did arrive, and the wrapper passes that diagnosis through
  instead of overwriting it.
* **A non-numeric provider response became a column of `NA` in silence.**
  `as.numeric()` turns text that is not a number into `NA` without complaint,
  so a provider answering with `"n/a"` or `".."` -- or renaming a column so the
  value column now holds a label -- handed back pure `NA`. That reads as "the
  provider has no data for these countries", which is a very different claim
  from "the response was not numeric". `fetch_eurostat()` and `fetch_oecd()`
  were exposed because they name the value column outright, where
  `fetch_owid()` auto-detects it and so refuses a non-numeric column up front.
  The count is now reported, with the offending values shown. A value the
  provider itself reported as missing is already `NA` and is not counted.
* **The provider adapters discarded duplicate rows in silence.**
  `fetch_owid()`, `fetch_eurostat()`, `fetch_oecd()` and `fetch_comtrade()` all
  end by keeping one row per country-year, which is the contract the downstream
  joins rely on. But they kept whichever row came first and said nothing, so a
  provider answering with two different values for one country-year handed back
  an arbitrary one -- order-dependently, and invisibly. The count is now
  reported, as it is everywhere else this package drops rows. A genuine panel
  is untouched, and a clean response stays silent. `country_data()`'s own
  collapse is deliberately left quiet: there the cause is two `iso2c` codes
  mapping to one `iso3c`, which is structural to the World Bank country list
  and would fire on essentially every call.
* **A source whose keys collapsed repeated the caller's rows in silence.**
  Standardisation merges keys as well as failing on them -- "United States" and
  "USA" both reach `USA` -- and `add_indicator()`'s join then matched twice, so
  a two-row frame came back with three rows and one country holding two
  different values. dplyr only warns on many-to-many relationships, not
  one-to-many, so nothing was said. `join_world()` has warned about this since
  it gained that check; the source adapters now do too. The standardised key is
  also checked directly, because the collapse check by construction only sees a
  code reached from *more than one* raw value -- a source that simply returns
  `USA` twice collapses nothing and so said nothing, while the join still
  turned two rows into three. A genuine panel is untouched: the check keys on
  `iso3c` and `year` together wherever a year column exists. The documented
  fetch contract now states the uniqueness requirement, which it never did --
  it specified the columns and said missing data should arrive as `NA` rather
  than a missing row, but never that the key must not repeat.
* **A cross-section joined to a multi-year fetch lost the year that
  distinguished the rows.** Dropping the fetch's `year` column is right for a
  single-year fetch, where it broadcasts the one value across the frame. Done
  unconditionally, a two-row cross-section joined to a three-year source came
  back as six rows: the same `gdp` three times, against values whose year had
  just been deleted, so nothing recorded which year any of them belonged to.
  The column is now kept when it is doing work, and `add_indicator()` says why
  the frame grew.
* **`add_indicator()` handed back the source's own key column** as though it
  were requested data, because the columns to add excluded only `"iso3c"`. A
  source keyed on anything else left a stray column -- `country` next to
  `iso3c` -- in the result.
* **Re-registering a source kept serving the old one's answers.** The
  session cache keys on the indicator, countries and years but not on `fetch`,
  so correcting a broken adapter and registering it again returned the broken
  result -- which is what writing an adapter looks like. Registering a name now
  drops that source's cached answers.
* **An optional column argument was not validated like a required one.**
  `quo_arg_name()` gives every unquoted column argument its "must name a
  column, not `gdp + 1`" error, with the advice to compute the column with
  `mutate()` first -- and for the *required* arguments it did. Twelve
  optional ones called `rlang::as_name()` directly, so an expression reached
  the caller as rlang's own "Can't convert a call to a string", naming neither
  the argument nor what it wanted. In several functions the required argument
  was checked and the optional one beside it was not: `bubble_map()` validated
  `size` but not `color`, `flow_map()` validated `from` and `to` but not
  `weight`, `cartogram_map()` validated `weight` but not `fill`. Now covered:
  `per_capita(pop)`, `aggregate_regions(weight)`, `rank_countries(within)`,
  `flow_matrix(weight)`, `flow_map(weight)`, `bubble_map(color)`,
  `cartogram_map(fill)`, `gridded_cartogram(fill)`,
  `cartogram_diagnostics(weight)`, `interactive_map(tooltip)`,
  `animate_world(time)` and `join_world(country_col)`. `within`'s deliberate
  character-vector form is unaffected.
* **Three optional columns were never checked for existence either.**
  `per_capita(pop = )` left the population vector `NULL` and failed with base
  R's "replacement has 0 rows, data has 4"; `aggregate_regions(weight = )` and
  `rank_countries(within = )` failed from inside dplyr. All three now say which
  column is missing, as their required arguments already did.
* **A data frame was accepted where a country vector belongs.**
  `as.character()` on a data frame deparses each *column* into a string, so
  `neighbors(my_df)` came back with the two "countries" `c("USA", "FRA")` and
  `c(1, 2)` -- silently, because those are just strings that match nothing and
  every row then reads as "country not found". Nearly every other verb here
  takes `data` as its first argument, so handing a frame to one that takes a
  vector is the natural mistake, and eight of them took it:
  `neighbors()`, `convert_country()`, `country_timeline()`,
  `dissolve_country()`, `in_group()`, `distance_between()`,
  `check_country_match()` and `repair_country_names()`. `gini()` and `theil()`
  already refused a data frame; all of them now do. A data frame is only the
  common case -- `as.character()` deparses *any* list element that is not a
  single value, so `list(c("FRA", "DEU"))` collapsed to the one string
  `c("FRA", "DEU")` and returned a single `NA` where two codes were asked for.
  A flat list of scalars, a matrix and a factor all coerce correctly and are
  left alone.
* **`aggregate_regions()` crashed on the package's own `sf` output.** An `sf`
  frame is the one geometry shape this verb can aggregate correctly -- it
  carries a single row per country, so the totals are right -- but `dplyr`'s
  `sf`-aware `summarise()` unions the geometries per group, and the bundled
  Natural Earth polygons include two invalid ones (Sudan and Mozambique). So
  `join_world(geometry = "sf") |> aggregate_regions(population)` died with
  the raw GEOS error `TopologyException: side location conflict`, while the
  same call
  on a plain frame worked. It also drew the "aggregating counts each country
  once per geometry row" warning, which is true of a polygon frame and false of
  an `sf` one. The geometry is now dropped up front -- the documented return
  was always "a tibble of `by` plus the aggregated value" -- giving results
  identical to dropping it by hand, and the warning is confined to the polygon
  case where the hazard is real.
* **Four verbs reorder your rows and did not say so.** `growth_rate()`,
  `lag_by_country()`, `diff_by_country()` and `interpolate_missing()` read each
  country's series in time order, so they return rows sorted by `iso3c` then
  `year` -- but documented only "`data` with a column added". A caller holding
  a vector alongside `data` and relying on position would have had it silently
  stop lining up. The sorting is required and unchanged; the documentation now
  states it.
* **`?interpolate_missing` described the wrong mechanism.** It said the
  `"countryatlas_imputed"` attribute is what "the map verbs read". They do not:
  provenance counts the `*_imputed` *columns* by name, which is why the
  provenance chain survives verbs that drop attributes, as `dplyr` does. The
  page now points at the columns and says the attribute is a convenience
  nothing in the package consumes.
* **An `sf` frame stopped being `sf` halfway through a pipeline.**
  `per_capita()`, `share_of_world()` and `standardize_country()` all document
  their result as "`data` with the requested columns added", and
  `rank_countries()` honours that -- but these three ended with
  `tibble::as_tibble()`, which strips the `sf` class. The geometry column
  survived, so nothing looked wrong until the next verb:
  `join_world(geometry = "sf") |> share_of_world(population) |> world_map()`
  died on "`data` has no map geometry", while the same pipeline through
  `rank_countries()` worked -- which is what gave it away. `sf` now survives
  all three. Every other class is still normalised to a tibble and grouping is
  still dropped, both of which `as_tibble()` had been doing at the same time
  and only one of which was wrong.
* **Three map verbs broke on a frame that already had the columns they join
  in.** Each attaches coordinates under a fixed name, and when the caller's
  frame already carried that name dplyr suffixed both sides to `.x`/`.y`,
  leaving the code reading the unsuffixed name to fail on a column that had
  been renamed out from under it -- always as an internal `vctrs` or `ggplot2`
  error that says nothing about countries:
  * `gridded_cartogram()` on a frame carrying `centroid_lon`/`centroid_lat`
    -- which `country_meta` supplies, so joining it for capitals or area
    first is ordinary -- failed with "Can't subset rows with
    `is.na(df$centroid_lon) | ...`".
  * `tile_map()` on a frame with a `row` or `col` column, names common enough
    to collide by accident, failed with "Problem while computing aesthetics".
  * `flow_map()` on a frame with `x0`, `y0`, `x1` or `y1` -- exactly what a
    caller who geocoded their own endpoints has -- failed with "Can't subset
    columns that don't exist".

  `bubble_map()` and `spike_map()` already dropped the caller's centroid
  columns before the same join; all three now drop the colliding copy, and the
  output is identical either way. Where the clashing column is one the verb
  actually reads -- a `fill` that is also a tile coordinate, a `weight` that is
  also an arc endpoint -- it is refused by name rather than silently dropped.
* **`deflate()` and `to_ppp()` did not guard the join collision `per_capita()`
  does.** All three fetch a series into a `.wdj_*` column and join it on
  `iso3c`/`year`. A caller whose own frame already had that column made dplyr
  suffix both sides to `.x`/`.y`, leaving the fetched column unreachable and
  the arithmetic operating on nothing. `per_capita()` has dropped the colliding
  column since it hit this; its two siblings now do the same.
* **`audit_coverage()` reported perfect coverage of nothing.**
  `tibble::as_tibble()` turns a bare vector into a one-column tibble called
  `value`, so a character vector of country codes -- the mirror of the mistake
  above -- came back as a coverage object whose three tables were all empty.
  That reads as "no missing data" when nothing had been examined at all.
  `standardize_country()` already refused a non-frame; this now does too.
* **`world_table()` returned an empty table without saying why.** Rows whose
  value is `NA` cannot be ranked, so they are dropped -- but when that removed
  every row, a frame that went in with countries in it came back with none, and
  nothing distinguished "the column is empty" from "there was nothing to
  report". It now says so, while a partial drop (the normal case) and a 0-row
  input stay silent.
* **`recenter` was silently dropped on the polygon backend.** The polygon
  backend returns lon/lat vertices, and recentring them means re-splitting
  every ring at the new antimeridian -- which is what
  `sf::st_break_antimeridian()` does on the `sf` backend. `recenter` was simply
  ignored on the polygon side, so `join_world(recenter = 150)`,
  `attach_geometry(recenter = 150)` and `world_geometry(recenter = 150)`
  returned byte-identical coordinates to `recenter = NULL` and drew an
  Atlantic-centred map for someone who had asked for a Pacific-centred one.
  They now say so and point at `geometry = "sf"`, in the same shape as the
  existing bounding-box warning on that backend. `?world_geometry` was also
  the one help page that did not already describe `recenter` as an `sf`
  option.
* **`n_perm = 0` returned undocumented `NA` p-values.** `morans_i()` documents
  the escape hatch ("use `0` to skip the test"), and all three statistics
  validate `n_perm` with a lower bound of zero -- but `local_morans()` and
  `gearys_c()` described the argument only as "permutations for the
  pseudo-p-value", so passing `0` handed back a whole column of `NA` with
  nothing to say the test had been skipped. All three now document it, and say
  that `p_value` comes back `NA`.
* **Two bundled datasets did not name every column they have.**
  `?country_meta` listed sixteen of its seventeen columns, omitting `income` --
  the World Bank income group that `audit_coverage(by = "income")` and
  `rank_countries(within = "income")` read -- and `?world_snapshot` called
  `continent`, `region` and `income` merely "classifications" without naming
  them.
* **`interpolate_missing()` silently renamed a duplicated column.**
  `complete_years()` and `audit_coverage()` reject a frame with two columns of
  the same name; this one filled the first and handed the second back renamed
  -- `v` and `v` in, `v` and `v.1` out, without a word.
* **`index_to()` indexed a whole country to `NA` depending on row order.**
  `year == base_year` is `NA` for a missing year, and `x[c(NA, TRUE)]` returns
  an `NA` element *before* the real match, so taking the first element picked
  up the `NA`. The same three observations gave 100/150/50 with the missing
  year last and `NA`/`NA`/`NA` with it first. The base year is now chosen from
  the rows that have one.
* **`compare_sources()` invented a country from an unparseable year.**
  `read_year()` deliberately records `NA` for a time value it cannot parse, and
  subsetting a data frame by a condition containing `NA` appends a row of all
  `NA` -- a phantom country with no `iso3c`, which then survived the join into
  the comparison table.
* **A brace in borrowed text replaced the message it was reporting.** A `cli`
  bullet is a template, so text taken from somewhere else -- a parallel
  worker's error, an on-disk cache read failure, `countrycode`'s own complaint
  -- had its braces interpolated. A worker failing with `bad json {"a": 1}`
  reported "Could not evaluate cli `{}` expression" and the real failure was
  gone, which is the worst possible moment to lose it. Four sites now pass the
  borrowed text through as a value.
* **A bare column in a string-taking verb gave `object 'v' not found`.** Nine
  of these verbs take an unquoted column through tidy eval; three take strings
  -- `interpolate_missing(value)`, `complete_years(value)` and
  `audit_coverage(indicator)`. Writing the bare column that works everywhere
  else produced base R's "object not found", naming neither the argument nor
  the string it wanted. They now say what to write -- `value = "v"` -- while
  leaving a genuine error in the argument untouched.

## Spatial statistics: weights first

`morans_i()` shipped with one hard-wired weight scheme, land-border contiguity.
An island has no land border, so Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia,
Indonesia, Madagascar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Iceland and every small
island state carried no weight and left the analysis -- 49 of the 191 countries
with data in `world_snapshot`. The omission is systematic, not random.

* **`country_weights()`** builds the weights as a first-class object:
  `"contiguity"`, `"knn"` (every country gets neighbours, islands included),
  `"distance"`, or `"custom"` -- which is how a *non-geographic* neighbourhood,
  trade volume or migration flows, goes through the same API.
* **`morans_i(weights = )`** accepts it, and now reports `n_excluded` and an
  `excluded` list-column whatever the scheme. The two answers differ and both
  are defensible: contiguity gives I = 0.61 on 142 countries, k-nearest gives
  0.47 on 189.
* **`local_morans()`** and **`lisa_map()`** give the LISA cluster
  classification and its map; **`gearys_c()`**, **`getis_ord()`** and
  **`spatial_lag()`** complete the set. No `spdep` required -- at ~200 countries
  the dense arithmetic is trivial.

## Data sources beyond the World Bank

A contract, not N bespoke fetchers.

* **`register_country_source()`** teaches the package a new provider. A registry
  rather than more `Suggests`, so a source with no CRAN package -- V-Dem, the
  IMF, a proprietary internal feed -- is a first-class citizen without the
  package depending on anything.
* **`fetch_indicator()`**, **`add_indicator()`** and **`country_sources()`** are
  the user-facing verbs; **`fetch_owid()`**, **`fetch_eurostat()`**,
  **`fetch_oecd()`** and **`fetch_comtrade()`** ship as built-in adapters, each
  gated on its own client package.
* **`compare_sources()`** is the one that earns its place. Anyone can call
  `owidR`; what nobody does is tell you that OWID and the World Bank disagree
  about GDP per capita for fourteen countries because of different vintages, PPP
  bases or territorial definitions. On the ISO spine that comparison is one
  join.
* `clear_wdi_cache()` generalises to **`clear_country_cache(source = )`**; the
  old name still works.

## Time

* **`historical_geometry()`** draws the world as it was, from CShapes 2.0
  (1886-2019) -- states *and* colonies, which is what makes a pre-decolonisation
  map possible at all. `world_geometry(year = )` and `attach_geometry(year = )`
  route to it.
* **The ISO spine does not reach back, and the package now says so.** ISO 3166
  was published in 1974 and never covered colonies, so `country_join(key = )`
  and `country_join_all(key = )` gain `"cowc"`, `"cown"` and `"gwn"` as
  alternate spines, and warn -- naming which table -- about the dependencies
  COW/GW cannot carry. `historical_geometry()` is keyed on
  `gwcode`, with `iso3c` as a best-effort extra that is `NA` for every entity
  that never had one.
* **`country_groups_history`** (new dataset) dates membership for twelve groups,
  so **`country_groups(as_of = )`** and **`in_group(as_of = )`** answer the
  question a panel actually asks. The United Kingdom was in the EU in 2016 and
  not in 2021; EFTA had eight members in 1965 and has four now. Commonwealth,
  G20 and OPEC are deliberately *not* dated -- their histories involve
  suspensions and contested dates, and a fabricated date is worse than an absent
  one. The table is validated at build time against `country_groups_tbl`.
* **`country_timeline()`** reads the crosswalk both ways: what the USSR became,
  and what Estonia was part of. **`audit_time_coverage()`** catches the rows a
  successful join leaves wrong -- South Sudan with 1995 data, Czechoslovakia
  with 2001 data.

## Honesty as a feature

* **`world_map(na_style =)`** chooses how missing countries are drawn:
  `"grey"` (the default, and ambiguous -- grey reads as "low" to many people),
  `"hatched"` (diagonal hatching via the optional `ggpattern`, unmistakable and
  greyscale-safe), `"outline"` or `"omit"`.
* **`world_map(footnote = "auto")`** generates the coverage line -- "174 of 195
  countries shown; 21 missing" -- so a map cannot quietly overstate what it
  covers. A string is used verbatim.
* **`coverage_map()`** maps data availability itself, the cartographic
  counterpart to `audit_coverage()`'s table.
* **`world_map(classification_report = TRUE)`** attaches the breaks, the method
  and the count of countries per class to the plot. A map whose top class holds
  one country and whose bottom holds ninety is misleading, and the counts say so
  at once.
* **`classify_compare()`** draws the same choropleth under several
  classifications with that table for each. On `world_snapshot`'s GDP per
  capita, equal-interval and pretty breaks put 173 of 189 countries (92%) in a
  single class while quantile spreads them 38/38/37/38/38 -- the difference
  between a map that says something and one that says nothing.
  `?world_map` now states Brewer & Pickle's (2002) finding that quantiles read
  best and Jenks materially worse, with the citation, since that is the reverse
  of the common GIS default.
* **`value_by_alpha_map()`** encodes the value in colour and an equalising
  variable (usually population) in opacity, over a neutral background. It is the
  answer to the small-number problem -- an eleven-thousand-person country's rate
  shouting as loudly as a billion-person country's -- and unlike a cartogram it
  solves it without distorting geometry (Roth, Woodruff & Johnson 2010).

## Honesty, continued

* **`disputed_territories`** (new dataset) records *that* a territory is
  contested and *who the parties are*. It does not adjudicate, rank claims or
  imply any claim is better founded. **`dispute_policy()`** records which map
  convention you are using -- and warns that selecting `"de_jure"` does not
  change a single shape, because the package ships no claimed-boundary
  geometry. **`check_dispute_coverage()`** and `world_map(disputes = "mark")`
  stop a contested area passing unremarked.
* **`world_map(uncertainty = )`** switches the fill to a **value-suppressing
  uncertainty palette** (Correll, Moritz & Heer 2018): the value range contracts
  as uncertainty rises, so an uncertain estimate cannot claim an extreme colour,
  and the legend becomes the value x uncertainty grid.
* **`rate_check()`** flags rates computed over denominators too small to trust,
  and **`smooth_rates()`** shrinks them toward the global rate by
  empirical-Bayes. On a five-country example Tuvalu's rate shrinks from 2.7e-4
  to 5.9e-5 at a weight of 0.08, while China's is untouched at 0.9999.
* **`interpolate_missing()`** fills panel gaps and **flags every value it
  invents, non-optionally**. Gaps longer than `max_gap` are left alone, because
  interpolating across a decade is not interpolation. `world_map()` reads the
  flag and notes it in the caption.
* **`projection_distortion()`** measures what a projection does, numerically.
  It cross-validates: every equal-area projection reads exactly 1.000 areal
  distortion, Mercator reads 4.4 mean and 132 max, and Mercator alone reads
  ~0 degrees angular.

## Projections you can interrogate

* **`projection_info()`** returns the property table for all thirteen
  projections: construction family, equal-area, conformal, the PROJ string, and
  a note on what each is good for. `subset(projection_info(), equal_area)` is
  the short answer to "what may I safely use for a choropleth".
* **`projection_compare()`** draws one choropleth under several projections at
  once, holding the data and the classification fixed so only the CRS varies.
* **`tissot_map()`** draws Tissot's indicatrix -- circles of equal ground radius
  projected with everything else. On Mercator they stay round and grow
  enormously; on Equal Earth they hold their area and shear. It makes the
  package's honesty claim visible rather than asserted.
* Equal Earth is now documented as the recommended default for world thematic
  maps, with the Savric, Patterson & Jenny (2019) citation. The default itself
  is unchanged.

## Provenance

* **`map_provenance()`** reports what went into a map -- package version,
  snapshot year, geometry backend, projection, classification and its breaks,
  fill column, and countries shown versus missing. Every one of those is already
  known at plot time; this makes it readable. **Every** map verb records it, not
  just `world_map()`: a provenance feature that covers some of the verbs is
  worse than none, because the gap only shows up when someone relies on it.
* **`inst/CITATION`** credits the package *and* the sources it reconciles:
  `countrycode` (Arel-Bundock, Enevoldsen & Yetman 2018), the World Bank,
  Natural Earth, and the papers behind Equal Earth, the classification guidance,
  value-by-alpha and Moran's I. `citation("countryatlas")` now produces the full
  set.

## Flows, reporting and subnational

* **`flow_matrix()`**, **`country_network()`** and **`od_map()`** turn a
  bilateral table into a matrix, a network summary, or small multiples -- the
  answer to the arc map's problem, which is that past a few dozen flows
  `flow_map()` is a plate of spaghetti.
* **`country_factsheet()`** and **`world_table()`** are the last mile for the
  audience that wanted a table. `world_table()` uses `gt` when it is installed
  and a tibble otherwise.
* **`standardize_subnational()`**, **`nuts_geometry()`** and
  **`subnational_map()`** go one level below the country, scoped to where a
  maintained code system and free geometry both exist. There is no admin2, no
  bundled boundary data, and no attempt to pretend a French departement and a US
  state are the same kind of object.

## Cartograms, projections and renderers

* **`gridded_cartogram()`** allocates one cell per N people by largest
  remainder, so the reader can count. **`cartogram_diagnostics()`** reports the
  residual area error, because cartograms fail quietly -- on the bundled
  snapshot the default contiguous cartogram leaves Greenland 371x too large.
* `cartogram_map(type = "flow")` routes to `cartogramR`'s Gastner-Seguy-More
  algorithm. Each `type` now gates only on the package it actually needs.
* **`interactive_map(engine = "mapgl")`** renders through MapLibre GL, and
  **`globe_map(interactive = TRUE)`** turns the static orthographic globe into
  one you can spin with the mouse.
* **`world_map(engine = "tmap")`** is an alternative static renderer for people
  already working in tmap. The package stays ggplot2-native; this is a door, not
  a second front door.
* `world_query()` gains `layer`, `facet`, `size` and `n_bins`, so the
  database-side path can express bubbles, binning and small multiples.

## Deprecations

* **`wdj_overrides()`** now warns. It has been soft-deprecated since 2.0.0, but
  an interactive-only note never reaches the scripts still calling it. Use
  `country_overrides()`; the two return the same table.
* **`?wdj_overrides` now says it is deprecated.** The code started warning in
  this release, but the shared help page still described `wdj_overrides()` as
  "a backward-compatible alias" and its examples called it twice -- so the one
  place a reader goes to check was describing the previous release's behaviour,
  and running the documented examples emitted the deprecation warning. The
  examples now use `country_overrides()`.
* **`options(countryatlas.gdp_compat = TRUE)`** now warns. The
  `gdp_per_capita_2015` alias dates from 1.0.0 and will be removed.

## Other changes

* **New `remove_country_source()`.** `register_country_source()` had no
  counterpart, so registering was permanent for the session: anything that
  registered a source -- an example, a test, an exploratory script -- left
  `country_sources()` reporting different rows for the rest of the session with
  no way back. Removing a source also drops its memoised answers, so
  re-registering the same name cannot serve results from the function that was
  just removed. The five built-in sources are protected.
* **The persistent World Bank cache now expires and is size-capped.** It used
  `memoise::cache_filesystem()`, which has neither, so the directory grew
  without bound for the life of the installation -- while CRAN policy allows a
  cache under `tools::R_user_dir()` only if "sizes are kept as small as
  possible and the contents are actively managed (including removing outdated
  material)". It now uses `cachem::cache_disk()`: entries expire after 30 days
  and the least-recently-used go once the directory passes 50 MB, both
  adjustable with `options(countryatlas.cache_max_age = )` and
  `options(countryatlas.cache_max_size = )`. Expiry also matters on the merits,
  since World Bank observations are revised. Entries written by earlier
  versions are swept once, and a corrupt entry is now silently re-fetched
  rather than warned about and left in place. `cachem` is an unconditional
  dependency of `memoise`, so this adds nothing to install.
* **`clear_country_cache()` can now release the geometry caches.** Called with
  no `source` it also drops the Natural Earth `sf` layer held per scale (tens
  of megabytes at `scale = "medium"`) and the memoised `map_data("world")`
  tibble (~99,000 rows per override set). Those are the largest things the
  package keeps in memory and there was no API to release them; in a Shiny app
  or a plumber process they were held for the life of the process. Naming a
  `source` leaves geometry alone. Relatedly, `world_polygons` is memoised in
  `.onLoad()` rather than at build time, which is both memoise's own guidance
  and what makes the cache reachable.
* **`add_indicator()` no longer claims "only what you need is fetched".** True
  for `comtrade`, partly true for `wdi`, and false for `owid`, `eurostat` and
  `oecd`, which download the full dataset and filter locally -- so
  `add_indicator(one_row, "owid", "life-expectancy")` transfers every country
  and year to keep one value. `?add_indicator` now says which is which.
* **`?map_provenance` listed 15 of the verbs that carry provenance.**
  `od_map()`, `subnational_map()`, `projection_compare()` and
  `world_map(engine = "tmap")` also carry it; `tissot_map()` is the one map
  verb that carries none, and now says so. A test loops over every verb and
  asserts the provenance names the column the caller asked about.
* **`?historical_geometry` did not document `owner` or `capname`**, which it
  returns when the installed `cshapes` supplies them. `owner` is what makes
  `dependencies = TRUE` legible, so it is worth naming.
* **`?country_groups_tbl` gives the membership date.** It pointed at the
  package `NEWS` for the reference date, where two different dates were on
  record; the Rd now states 2026-06-01 and documents the `as_of` attribute
  that carries it in code. An Rd should not delegate a fact to a changelog.
* **`?disputed_territories` says that nothing in the package reads
  `administered_by` or `claimed_by`.** `dispute_layer()` and `dispute_note()`
  key on `iso3c` alone; the party columns are for your own filtering, and are
  documented precisely so such a filter is writable.
* **The `README` computes the count it quotes.** "42 of 215 countries silently
  vanish" was hard-coded prose next to a figure built from a live fetch, so it
  drifted as the World Bank revised its coverage -- by the time anyone checked
  it was 37 of 210. Both now come from one computation.
* **`stats`, `utils`, `tools`, `grDevices` and `parallel` are declared in
  `Imports`.** They were called with `::` and not declared. Base-priority
  packages are exempt from the undeclared-`::` check, so this was never a check
  finding; declaring them is conventional and removes any dependence on how
  that exemption is treated in future R.
* **Two reads of `ggplot` internals are isolated.** ggplot2 4.0.0 moved
  `ggplot` to S7 with `@` accessors and a compatibility layer over `$`.
  `animate_world()` now reads the title with `ggplot2::get_labs()` where
  available, and `cartogram_map()` stores its frame in an attribute so
  `cartogram_diagnostics()` need not reach into the plot's data slot at all.
* **Build-time validation that only reported.** `?country_groups_history` says
  the table "is validated at build time against `country_groups_tbl`"; the
  script compared, `message()`d a mismatch, and wrote the `.rda` anyway, so a
  disagreement scrolled past in a build log -- and `NEWS` records that this
  drift has already bitten once. It is a hard `stop()` now, accumulating every
  mismatch first, and it reads the snapshot from the working tree rather than
  from the installed package (which would compare the new table against the
  *previous* release's snapshot). `world_snapshot`'s assembly gained
  `relationship = "one-to-one"` and a uniqueness assertion, and
  `disputed_territories` now validates `administered_by` / `claimed_by`
  against its documented six placeholders in both directions.
* **`country_meta$area_km2` is anchored to real areas.** The formula that
  produced it lived in `data-raw/` as a copy of the package's
  `ring_area_km2()` that had silently missed the antimeridian fix -- and
  nothing pinned the column numerically, the only assertions being `> 0` and
  ">90% non-NA", both of which a 179x-inflated value passes. The copies are
  reunited, the build script self-checks against the analytic area for an
  equatorial square, a wrapped square and a polar cap, and the shipped values
  are checked against ten known country areas. (The shipped values were
  correct; nothing had established that.) `data-raw/overrides_snapshot.R`'s
  copy of the override table is likewise pinned to the package's.
* **The CI matrix gained a `_R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_` leg.** All five existing
  legs install every `Suggests`, so none of them ran the configuration CRAN
  actually runs -- which is how a broken `\link{}` to a Suggests-only topic
  reached a release. The Linux legs also generate `tr_TR.UTF-8`, so the
  Turkish-dotless-i hardening that broke 2.0.0 on CRAN's Fedora flavours is
  actually exercised rather than skipped.
* **The silence policy covers every offline verb.** It enforced "a correct
  call to any verb is completely silent" for 39 of 102 exports, and every
  warning bug found in the pre-release review sat in the gap. It now covers 32
  more, plus the cross-product of `world_map()`'s `na_style` / `disputes` /
  `style` arguments and a zero-row leg for the rate verbs -- which is what
  found the `deflate()` and `rate_check()` bugs above.
* **The *Honest maps* vignette named two countries that contiguity weights do
  not drop.** Its island list included the United Kingdom and Indonesia, but the
  UK keeps its land border with Ireland and Indonesia keeps its borders with
  Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste -- so neither is excluded. A
  vignette about maps quietly misleading, quietly misleading. Corrected, and it
  now uses the two as the illustration that you cannot tell from the finished
  map who dropped out.
* **Two more vignette claims corrected.** *Getting started* called
  `world_snapshot$countries$income` "an ordered factor"; it is a plain factor
  whose levels are in income order, built that way deliberately in `data-raw/`,
  and `is.ordered()` is `FALSE`. *countryatlas and ggsql* said `DRAW spatial`
  arrived at ggsql 0.4.0 while three places in `R/` said 0.4.1 -- both are true
  of different components, but read together they were a contradiction, so the
  engine and the R package are now named separately.
* Every vignette's prose claims are pinned by tests. Three were already; the
  four added or rewritten since then were not, which is how the errors above
  survived. The README's are pinned too, including that its verb table covers
  every non-deprecated export.
* `as_of` documents what a bare year means. It resolves to 1 January, so
  `in_group("Croatia", "EU", as_of = 2013)` is `FALSE` -- Croatia joined that
  July. The convention was always this; only the documentation was silent, and
  the examples all sat far from a boundary. Pass `"YYYY-MM-DD"` when the month
  matters.
* Every figure in the vignettes now carries alt text, so the pkgdown site and
  the rendered articles are readable with a screen reader.
* The `geom_country_labels()` example labelled all 188 countries at once, which
  made `ggrepel` drop every one of them; it now shows the two idioms that work
  -- selecting a subset through `data`, and zooming in.
* Documentation and vignettes zoom with `coord_quickmap()` rather than
  `coord_cartesian()`. Both replace the map's coordinate system, but only the
  former keeps the latitude-dependent aspect ratio, so the Europe inset was
  being drawn without any fixed aspect at all.
* `DESCRIPTION` declares `Language: en-GB`, and `inst/WORDLIST` records the
  package's technical vocabulary, so the CRAN spell check reports real typos
  instead of 300 false positives.

* `common_indicators` gains the two price-conversion series `deflate()` and
  `to_ppp()` reach for by default.
* `inst/CITATION` credits the new methods: Anselin, Geary, Getis-Ord, Correll et
  al., Phillips-Sul, Gastner-Seguy-More and Schvitz et al. alongside the
  existing set.
* The mean Earth radius is one shared constant rather than three literals.
* A bad `projection` or `scale` now says which argument it means. Both were
  validated by `match.arg()` inside a shared helper, which produces R's
  anonymous `'arg' should be one of ...` -- naming neither the argument nor the
  function the user called. Seventeen exported functions take `projection` and
  nine take `scale`, so one poor message was reachable a great many ways.
* `Suggests` grows to 41 packages. That is heavy, and it is the price of a light
  core: nothing here is needed to install the package or to draw a choropleth.

# countryatlas 2.0.1

A patch release. The only behaviour change is to a test and to where an optional
DuckDB connection keeps its state; nothing in the package's own API moves.

## CRAN check failures

* `test-standardize.R`'s de-accenting test failed on CRAN's two r-devel Fedora
  flavours, which run in a latin1 locale. The test asserted that outside a
  UTF-8 locale `iconv(x, to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")` cannot produce a resolvable
  spelling -- generalising from `LC_CTYPE=C`, which is the case
  `?country_overrides` actually documents. That is not what glibc does: the
  `\u00e7` escape makes the input UTF-8 *marked* in every locale, so `iconv`
  reads it as UTF-8 and only the target charmap matters. Latin-1 has
  transliteration data and still yields `"Curacao"`; only `C`/POSIX, which has
  none, degrades to `NA` or `"Cura?ao"`. The test now asserts the invariant that
  holds in every locale -- de-accenting may or may not resolve, but it never
  resolves to a *different* country -- and passes under `C`, latin1, latin9 and
  UTF-8.

## Housekeeping

* `as_ggsql_source(format = "duckdb")` now opens its connection with
  `duckdb(shared_home = FALSE)` where the installed duckdb supports it (1.4 and
  later). By default duckdb keeps downloaded extensions and secrets in
  `~/.duckdb`, which a throwaway in-memory table has no business creating in the
  user's home; `R CMD check` also reports a new `~/.duckdb` among "new files in
  some other directories".
* The test suite no longer writes into the checking account's file space.
  Rendering one `girafe()` widget -- which `interactive_map(engine =
  "ggiraph")` does, and which no 1.0.0 test did -- makes `gdtools` copy 90
  Liberation font files into `tools::R_user_dir("gdtools", "data")`. `R CMD
  check` snapshots that tree and reports anything new, which is the NOTE CRAN
  raised against 1.0.0 for our own WDI cache (fixed separately, in
  `wdj_cache_dir()`). A new `tests/testthat/setup-user-dirs.R` points the R
  user directories at the session temp directory before any test runs, so the
  widget still renders, just somewhere disposable.
* `?clear_wdi_cache` claimed nothing was written until a World Bank fetch
  succeeded, so an offline session "never creates" the cache directory. The
  directory is in fact created the first time a *cached* fetch is attempted,
  because that is when the location has to be proved writable -- a failed
  fetch leaves it behind empty. The help page now describes what happens.

# countryatlas 2.0.0

A major release that wires countryatlas into the database-rendering world via
'ggsql', widens the map vocabulary, and fixes several correctness issues found
by auditing 1.0.0. The version is bumped to 2.0.0 because the bug fixes change
the output of `world_map()` (quantile binning), `bubble_map()` / `flow_map()`
(de-duplicated symbols), `geom_country_labels()` (label placement) and
`convert_country()` (override-only entities), so code that depended on the old
behaviour may see different maps or values.

## New: database-side rendering with ggsql

* `as_ggsql_source()` exports a curated, ISO-reconciled, WDI-joined table (with
  `sf` geometry WKB-encoded) as a [ggsql](https://ggsql.org) source: a DuckDB
  connection, a Parquet file, or a nanoarrow stream. countryatlas does the
  reconciliation ggsql's static bundled world can't; ggsql does the database
  push-down and Vega-Lite output countryatlas doesn't.
* `world_query()` emits a `ggsql` spatial query (`VISUALISE … DRAW spatial
  PROJECT TO … SCALE … LABEL …`), a dependency-free string builder.
* `interactive_map(engine = "ggsql")` registers the data and renders the map in
  DuckDB, returning a Vega-Lite widget.
* `ggsql`, `duckdb`, `DBI` and `nanoarrow` are optional `Suggests`. See the new
  *countryatlas and ggsql* vignette.

## New: maps, projections and helpers

* `globe_map()`: an orthographic globe choropleth, with `backend = "sf"`
  (smoothest limb) or `backend = "polygon"` (needs only `maps` + `mapproj`).
* `spin_globe()`: a rotating-globe animated GIF (one `globe_map()` frame per
  central longitude, assembled with `gifski` or `magick`).
* `facet_map()`: small-multiple choropleths (the static counterpart to
  `animate_world()`).
* `wdj_crs()` gains eight projections (`mercator`, `winkel_tripel`, `eckert4`,
  `gall_peters`, `orthographic`, `azimuthal_equal_area`, `north_polar`,
  `south_polar`); `world_map()` / `world_geometry()` accept them all.
* `locate_country()`: point-in-polygon lookup tagging `lon`/`lat` with `iso3c`.
* `repair_country_names()`: the "act on it" companion to
  `check_country_match()`: auto-applies confident string-distance fixes.
* `country_join_all()`: reduce-join many messy country tables on the ISO spine.
* `growth_rate()`, `index_to()`, `share_of_world()`: panel analysis helpers.
* `country_overrides()`: preferred name for `wdj_overrides()` (kept as an
  alias) after the rename to countryatlas.
* `country_groups_tbl` gains `Mercosur`, `GCC`, `Nordic` and `Visegrad`.
* `country_borders()`: a tidy adjacency edge list built from polygon topology
  (`sf::st_touches()`), with `neighbors()` for a vectorised per-country lookup.
* `distance_between()`: great-circle (haversine) distance between two
  countries' centroids; needs neither `sf` nor the network.
* `dorling_map()`: the Dorling cartogram promoted to a first-class verb, with
  `k`/`itermax` tuning; `cartogram_map()` itself gains `...` passthrough to the
  underlying `cartogram::cartogram_*()` call.

## New: historical entities, inequality and spatial statistics

* `historical_codes`: a curated, dated crosswalk of dissolved entities
  (Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Netherlands
  Antilles, North/South Yemen, pre-2011 Sudan, United Arab Republic,
  Tanganyika/Zanzibar, North/South Vietnam, Serbia and Montenegro) to their
  successor states, with retired ISO codes where they existed. Kosovo is
  included among the Yugoslav successors on a territory basis (documented).
* `dissolve_country()`: resolve a mixed vector of historical *and* modern
  names to successor `iso3c` rows (one-to-many, dated); modern names pass
  through as single rows, so a whole messy column pipes in unchanged.
* `check_country_match()` gains a `historical` column. It flags dissolved
  entities **even when countrycode "matches" them**. The headline case is
  `"USSR"`, which countrycode silently resolves to Russia's `RUS`, so
  Soviet-era data becomes Russian data with no warning.
* `correlate_indicators()`: pairwise indicator correlations on the spine
  (pearson/spearman, pairwise-complete, per-pair `n`), tidy long output.
* `beta_convergence()` / `sigma_convergence()`: the two standard convergence
  diagnostics: the growth-on-initial-level regression (with implied
  convergence speed and half-life) and per-year cross-country dispersion.
* `gini()` and `theil()`: inequality across countries, population-weightable;
  `theil()` decomposes exactly into between/within components when a grouping
  (continent, income) is supplied.
* `lag_by_country()` / `diff_by_country()`: panel lag and difference grouped
  by `iso3c` and ordered by `year`, completing the panel toolkit around
  `growth_rate()` / `index_to()` / `complete_years()`.
* `morans_i()`: global Moran's I with a permutation pseudo-p-value, computed
  on the row-standardised `country_borders()` adjacency. No `spdep`
  dependency: the weights come from the package's own curated topology.
* `spike_map()`: triangular spikes at country centroids (height ∝ value), the
  overplotting-resistant cousin of `bubble_map()`; needs only `maps`.
* `convert_country()` accepts `to = "name_<lang>"` (`"name_fr"`, `"name_es"`,
  `"name_zh"`, …) for localized country names via countrycode's CLDR tables.
* `world_map(style = "binned")` legends now show SI-formatted breaks
  (`4M`, not `4e+06`) when `scales` is installed; the continuous scale uses
  the same formatter.

## Bug fixes

* `bivariate_map()` errored on every call ("the condition has length > 1",
  pre-dating 2.0.0). The two fill columns were injected into
  `biscale::bi_class()` with `!!rlang::sym()`, but `bi_class()` reads them
  with `as.character(substitute(...))` rather than tidy eval, so the
  injection deparsed into a multi-element vector inside `biscale`. The
  happy path is now covered by a test (the old one only checked that the
  function errors cleanly when `sf` is *absent*).
* `as_ggsql_source()` and `interactive_map(engine = "ggsql")` errored on any
  `sf` input -- the whole point of the ggsql bridge. `sf::st_as_binary()`
  returns a classed `WKB` object, which `tibble` rejects ("all columns must
  be vectors"); the geometry column is now the plain list of raw vectors
  that `nanoarrow` encodes as binary and `DBI` writes as a `BLOB`.
* `projection = "winkel_tripel"` errored on every render -- one of the eight
  projections this release adds. The CRS built fine and the geometry
  projected fine, but `ggplot2::coord_sf()`'s graticule collapses to a
  degenerate single-point segment under PROJ's Winkel Tripel, which GEOS
  rejects ("point array must contain 0 or >1 elements"). The graticule is now
  skipped for that projection only; [theme_world_map()] blanks `panel.grid`
  anyway, so nothing visible changes. All 13 projections are now covered by a
  full-render test.
* `world_geometry("coastline", geometry = "sf")` errored with a GEOS
  `TopologyException` in every projection except `"plate_carree"`: a couple
  of Natural Earth rings are self-intersecting and `sf::st_union()` (unlike
  the spatial predicates) refuses them. The geometry is repaired before the
  union.
* `world_geometry(region = c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax))` -- and `world_data()`
  / `attach_geometry()` with a bounding-box `region` -- errored on the `sf`
  backend ("Loop 0 is not valid"), because `sf::st_crop()` runs under the
  strict S2 engine on unprojected geometry. It now clips with the GEOS
  planar predicate, as `country_borders()` / `locate_country()` already did.
* `convert_country()`'s `warn` argument was documented but silently ignored
  (every internal `countrycode()` call is wrapped in `suppressWarnings()`,
  because countrycode also warns on intermediate hops that
  `convert_country()` goes on to recover). It now reports inputs that match
  no country, like `standardize_country()` does. A recognised country whose
  destination value is genuinely missing still returns `NA` quietly.
* `world_map()` / `globe_map()`'s `na_label` was accepted and silently
  ignored. The `"quantile"`, `"jenks"` and `"categorical"` legends now label
  their missing-data key with it (the continuous and binned colourbars have
  no `NA` key to name, which the documentation now says).
* Kosovo's `XKX` resolves for `country` and `flag` from `from = "iso3c"`,
  not just from its name. It has no row at all in `countrycode::codelist`,
  so everything derived from the code was `NA` -- which surfaced as
  `country_borders()` / `neighbors()` returning `NA` names for Kosovo's four
  land borders, `locate_country(add = "country")` returning `NA` for points
  inside it, and `standardize_country(add = c("country", "flag"))` doing the
  same. The curated fallback table now carries the name and flag too.
* `per_capita()` without an explicit `pop` column died with an opaque
  `vctrs` error ("Can't subset columns that don't exist: `.wdj_pop`") when
  the World Bank population fetch failed or timed out -- `fetch_wdi()`
  deliberately degrades to a keys-only tibble in that case. It now reports
  the failed fetch and points at the `pop` argument.
* `theil()` returns `NA` shares (not `NaN`) for a perfectly equal
  distribution, where the total is `0` and the shares are undefined --
  matching how `gini()` and `share_of_world()` treat a zero denominator.
* `country_join()` / `country_join_all()` no longer cross-join rows whose
  `iso3c` is `NA`: unmatched countries used to collapse to a single `NA` key and
  fan out into a Cartesian product. The joins now pass `na_matches = "never"`
  (#4).
* `country_join_all()` validates the length of `origin` (must be 1 or one per
  table) instead of failing with a cryptic "missing value where TRUE/FALSE
  needed" error (#16).
* `join_world()`'s auto-detection (`detect_country_col()`) honours the candidate
  priority order instead of picking the first column by data-frame position, so
  a `region` column no longer shadows a real `country` column (#6).
* `standardize_country(add = ...)` accepts any raw `countrycode` destination
  (e.g. `"iso3n"`) again instead of erroring with "subscript out of bounds"
  (#5).
* `standardize_country(origin = "iso3c")` now validates codes: strings that are
  not real ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes become `NA` (and are flagged by `warn`)
  rather than passing through uppercased and unchecked (#12).
* `country_data(latest = TRUE)` / `world_data(latest = TRUE)` for a single year
  now returns each country's most recent non-`NA` value: the fetch window is
  widened so an earlier observation can actually be found (#7).
* `fetch_wdi()` keeps `iso2c` / `country` for a country that appears only in a
  non-first indicator (they are coalesced across indicators) instead of leaving
  them `NA` (#8).
* `world_map()` / `globe_map()` with `style = "quantile"` / `"jenks"` no longer
  error on a constant, single-country, or all-`NA` value column; degenerate
  breaks now fall back to a single bin (#9).
* `flow_map()` returns the base map (instead of erroring) when no
  origin-destination pair resolves to a centroid (#10).
* `aggregate_regions(fun = "min"/"max")` returns `NA` for an all-`NA` group
  instead of `Inf` / `-Inf` (#11).
* `share_of_world()` returns `NA` (not `NaN`/`Inf`) when the (per-year) total is
  zero or non-finite (#13).
* `gini()` returns `NA` with a warning for negative input rather than a value
  outside the documented `[0, 1]` range (#14).
* `spike_map()` no longer produces `NaN` spike coordinates when every height is
  zero (#15).
* `world_query()` honours `transform` even when `palette = NULL`, emitting a
  standalone `SCALE fill VIA <transform>` clause (#17).
* `world_map(style = "quantile"/"jenks")` computed breaks over polygon
  **vertices**, so a country's geometric complexity biased the quantiles and the
  bins held unequal numbers of countries. Breaks are now computed on one value
  per country.
* `bubble_map(backend = "sf")` placed bubbles in projected metres on a degrees
  base map (off the map). The base map and bubbles now share one projected CRS
  via `coord_sf()`.
* Polygon centroids returned more than one row for ten `iso3c` codes (overrides
  map several names, such as Azores/Madeira → PRT, to one code), fanning out joins in
  `bubble_map()` / `flow_map()`. Centroids are now one antimeridian-safe row per
  country (the largest piece).
* `geom_country_labels()` placed labels at the bounding-box midpoint over all of
  a country's pieces, so the US / Fiji / NZ labels drifted into the wrong ocean.
  Labels now sit on each country's largest piece.
* `projection = "plate_carree"` built an incoherent PROJ string
  (`+proj=longlat … +units=m`); it is now true equirectangular (`+proj=eqc`).
* `convert_country()` only applied `wdj_overrides()` for `to = "iso3c"`, so
  override-only entities (e.g. "Canary Islands", "Azores", "Bonaire") returned
  `NA` for every other destination (continent, region, iso2c, flag, currency,
  country name, ...). It now resolves the override-corrected `iso3c` first and
  derives every other destination from that.
* Kosovo's `XKX` needed extra care: it has no row at all in
  `countrycode::codelist`, so deriving destinations purely via the `iso3c`
  round-trip above is `NA` for everything, which would have *regressed*
  `flag`/`region`/`country`, since 1.0.0 already resolved those via direct
  name matching (verified against the actual 1.0.0 code). `convert_country()`
  now recovers from the original name when the `iso3c` round-trip comes back
  empty, and fills `iso2c`/`continent` (which neither path classifies) from
  the same curated fallback `standardize_country()` uses. Net effect versus
  1.0.0: zero regressions, plus newly-working `continent`/`iso2c` for Kosovo,
  which also fixes `locate_country(..., add = "continent")` for points inside
  it.
* `interactive_map(..., tooltip = )` was accepted but silently ignored by every
  engine (pre-dating 2.0.0). The `"ggiraph"` and `"leaflet"` engines now use the
  supplied `tooltip` column, defaulting to `fill` as before when omitted.
* `world_data(overrides = )` (and `attach_geometry(overrides = )`) accepted a
  custom name -> iso3c override set but silently ignored it (pre-dating 2.0.0) --
  the geometry backend always matched with the default `wdj_overrides()`. The
  override set now flows through to both the polygon and `sf` matchers, so a
  custom mapping actually changes which polygons a country claims.
* `repair_country_names()` no longer records a no-op "repair" when a dissolved
  entity's own name (e.g. "Yugoslavia", which exists in the codelist but has
  no ISO code) comes back as its closest suggestion; `dissolve_country()` is
  the right tool there and is what the report now points to.
* A mistyped column name is now reported by countryatlas rather than leaking
  out of `ggplot2` as a bare "object 'x' not found" from inside a layer, or out
  of `vctrs` as a subscript error. `world_map()`, `globe_map()`, `facet_map()`,
  `tile_map()`, `bubble_map()` (both `size` and `color`), `spike_map()`,
  `flow_map()` (`from`, `to` and `weight`), `interactive_map()` (`fill` and
  `tooltip`) and `morans_i()` all validate up front, matching the message
  `per_capita()` / `rank_countries()` / `bivariate_map()` already gave.
  `morans_i()` in particular used to blame the geometry ("not enough bordering
  countries with data") for a column that simply wasn't there.
* `audit_coverage(indicator = )` silently reported `n_missing = 0` and
  `na_rate = NaN` for a column name that isn't in `data`; it now errors.
* `world_map()` / `globe_map()` errored ("'length = 2' in coercion to
  'logical(1)'") when `na_label` was longer than one element. The first
  element is used to label the single `NA` key, and a `NULL` / `NA` label
  still leaves the default formatter alone.
* `per_capita()` sent `start = Inf` to the World Bank when `data` had a `year`
  column that was entirely `NA`; it now falls back to last year, as it already
  did for a frame with no `year` column at all. Its degraded-fetch guard also
  covers the join keys now, so a partial population fetch produces the
  actionable "pass a population column" error rather than a raw `vctrs`
  subscript error.
* `theil()` returned `NaN` when every weight was zero; it now returns `NA`,
  matching `gini()`.
* `world_map()` / `globe_map()` with `style = "categorical"` and a numeric
  `fill` column let `ggplot2` raise "Continuous value supplied to a discrete
  scale" at *build* time, naming neither the column nor the style. They now
  error at the call, name the column, and point at `"quantile"` / `"jenks"` /
  `"binned"`.
* `bivariate_map()` no longer leaks `biscale`'s "var has missing values,
  omitted in finding classes" warning, which fired on essentially every call
  because real indicators always have gaps (the classes were valid either
  way). Any other `biscale` warning still passes through.
* A `region` given as lowercase `iso3c` codes silently lost countries. Falling
  through to name matching resolved some codes by accident (countrycode's
  country-name regex is case-insensitive, so `"usa"` matched) but not others
  (`"can"` did not), so `region = c("usa", "can")` subset to the USA alone.
  Codes are now recognised in any case, matching what
  `standardize_country(origin = "iso3c")` already accepted; an all-uppercase
  unknown code is still taken at face value rather than reinterpreted as a
  country name.
* `country_codes()` silently dropped a column name it did not recognise, so a
  typo returned a table quietly missing that column; it now errors and lists
  the available shortcuts.
* Every `sf`-backed call printed three or more lines of `sf` internals to the
  console -- `"Spherical geometry (s2) switched off"`, `st_intersection`'s
  `"although coordinates are longitude/latitude ... assumes that they are
  planar"`, and the matching `"switched on"`. The source was
  `sf::st_break_antimeridian()`, which toggles the s2 engine and runs an
  intersection internally, and which sits on the path of *every* `sf` call: a
  plain `attach_geometry(geometry = "sf")` emitted them, as did `world_map()`,
  `world_geometry()`, `country_borders()`, `neighbors()`, `morans_i()`,
  `locate_country()` and `simplify_geometry()`. It is now wrapped in the same
  `quietly_sf()` helper the other `sf` calls already used, so those paths are
  silent. (The notices bypass R's condition system, so `suppressMessages()`
  could not have caught them.)
* `cartogram_map()` / `dorling_map()` never validated their `weight` or `fill`
  column, the one place the rest of the package's existence checks were missed.
  A bad `weight` reached `cartogram` as `"missing value where TRUE/FALSE
  needed"` (or, for the Dorling variant, a warning about `max()` and then a
  wrong picture), and a bad `fill` was not caught at all.
* `index_to()` likewise never checked its value column, so a typo produced a
  `dplyr` error from inside `mutate()`; `base_year` and `to` are validated too.
* Scalar arguments are validated, so a typo or an `NA` names the argument
  instead of surfacing as `"missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed"`, `classInt`'s
  `"n less than 2"`, or a `PROJ` complaint about `lat_0`. Covers `n_bins`
  (`world_map()` / `globe_map()`, on the binned path as well as the
  quantile/jenks one), `lon`/`lat`/`recenter`/`lat0` (`globe_map()` on **both**
  backends -- the polygon one goes to `coord_map()` and previously accepted a
  nonsense orientation silently), `n` (`flow_map()`), `max_height` / `width` /
  `alpha` (`spike_map()`), `max_size` / `alpha` (`bubble_map()`), `keep`
  (`simplify_geometry()`), `threshold` (`repair_country_names()`), `n_perm`
  (`morans_i()`), and `n_frames` / `fps` / `width` / `height` (`spin_globe()`).
* Two of those scalar arguments were not merely reported badly -- they drew the
  wrong thing in silence. A negative `max_height` drew `spike_map()`'s spikes
  upside down, and `globe_map(lat = )` beyond +/-90 built a CRS `PROJ` rejects,
  which only surfaced later as `coord_sf()`'s `"crs not found: is it missing?"`.
* `geom_country_labels(repel = TRUE)` silently drew plain labels when `ggrepel`
  was not installed -- the one degraded optional backend the package did not
  announce, where `classInt`, `gganimate` and `rmapshaper` all report theirs. It
  now says so once per session (the argument defaults to `TRUE`, so reporting on
  every call would be noise), and stays quiet when `repel = FALSE` was asked for.
* The number of bins no longer depends on whether `classInt` is installed. For a
  fractional `n_bins`, `classInt` truncated internally while the base-quantile
  fallback passed the fraction to `seq(length.out = )` and produced one break
  more, so the same call binned differently in different environments. `n_bins`
  is now truncated to a whole number of bins before either backend sees it.
* `simplify_geometry(keep = 0)` errored under `rmapshaper` but was silently
  accepted by the `sf::st_simplify()` fallback, so the same call behaved
  differently depending on which optional package the caller had installed. A
  proportion of zero keeps no vertices, and both paths now reject it.
* Count arguments are bounded above as well as below. The scalar checks
  required a finite number, but several call sites then coerce with
  `as.integer()`, which returns `NA` past `2^31-1` -- so `n_perm = 1e10` or
  `n_bins = 1e10` produced "NAs introduced by coercion" or, worse, "missing
  value where TRUE/FALSE needed". `n_bins`, `n` (`flow_map()`,
  `lag_by_country()`, `diff_by_country()`), `n_perm` and `n_frames` now name the
  range. `morans_i()` also dropped a `max(0L, ...)` clamp that the validation
  had made unreachable.
* `lag_by_country()` / `diff_by_country()` clamped `n <= 0` up to `1`, so a lag
  of `0` quietly returned a lag of `1`; it now errors.
* `complete_years(value = )` silently ignored a column name that wasn't in
  `data` under the default `method = "none"`, while erroring from `all_of()` for
  `"locf"` / `"linear"`; it now errors consistently.
* `interactive_map(engine = "ggsql")` now gates on `ggsql` >= 0.4.1 rather than
  mere presence. `DRAW spatial` -- the clause `world_query()` emits -- arrived
  in the ggsql *engine* at 0.4.0, while the ggsql R package is still 0.3.3,
  which accepted the call and then failed inside its own SQL front end on a
  clause it did not know. The gate now refuses with an actionable message
  instead. `?world_query` records that the clause has shipped in the engine but
  not yet in the R bindings, and that `PROJECT TO` additionally needs a spatial
  backend (for DuckDB, its `spatial` extension); `world_query()` itself remains
  a dependency-free string builder.
* `R CMD check` no longer writes to the checking user's persistent cache. The
  `\donttest{}` examples fetch from the World Bank, so the memoised on-disk
  cache was being populated under `tools::R_user_dir()` during a check; under
  check it now lives in the session temp directory instead. Normal use is
  unchanged, and `options(countryatlas.cache_dir = )` still overrides both.
  `?clear_wdi_cache` now documents where the cache lives and how to disable it.
* An unmatched country in your data could be drawn as a real country. dplyr
  joins default to `na_matches = "na"`, so an `NA` ISO code matched another
  `NA` ISO code -- and Natural Earth carries Somaliland as a polygon with no
  ISO code. Any row whose country failed to resolve therefore joined onto
  Somaliland's geometry and was plotted there; with two or more unmatched rows
  the join also fanned out many-to-many, duplicating that polygon once per
  row so the visible fill was whichever happened to be drawn last. Affected
  `attach_geometry(geometry = "sf")` (and so `join_world()` and `world_map()`
  downstream of it) and `bubble_map(backend = "sf")`. All country-keyed joins
  in the package now pass `na_matches = "never"`, which `country_join()` and
  `country_join_all()` already did; the keyless polygon is still drawn, now
  correctly as a no-data feature. A test asserts the invariant across the
  whole namespace so a new join cannot reintroduce it.
* `world_query()` emitted a silently malformed query for any argument that was
  not a single string. `sprintf()` vectorises, so `projection = c("a", "b")`
  produced two `PROJECT TO` clauses, `source = character(0)` deleted the `FROM`
  line entirely, and `title = NA` became the literal text `'NA'` -- each of
  which surfaced only later, as a parse error inside ggsql's SQL front end.
  `world_query()` and `as_ggsql_source()` now validate their string arguments
  up front and name the offending one. `NULL` still omits an optional clause,
  and an empty `title` is still allowed.
* `as_ggsql_source(format = "parquet")` built its `COPY ... TO '<path>'`
  statement by string interpolation, so a path containing an apostrophe --
  legal in a filename -- closed the SQL literal early and broke the statement.
  The path is now quoted with `DBI::dbQuoteString()`, matching the
  `dbQuoteIdentifier()` treatment the table name already had.
* `suffix = character(0)` made the whole computation vanish. `suffix` is
  `paste0()`-ed onto the value column's name, and dplyr's `"{character(0)}" :=`
  is a silent no-op -- so `growth_rate(x, g, suffix = character(0))` returned
  `x` unchanged, with no growth column and no error. `suffix = NA` produced a
  column named `gNA`, and `suffix = ""` overwrote the source column in place.
  `per_capita()`, `growth_rate()`, `index_to()`, `share_of_world()`,
  `lag_by_country()` and `diff_by_country()` now require a single non-empty
  string (`lag_by_country()`/`diff_by_country()` still accept `NULL` for the
  default suffix).
* Several arguments produced an error that named nothing rather than the
  argument at fault:
  * `convert_country(to = c("country", "continent"))` -- a plausible attempt at
    two destinations -- raised "the condition has length > 1", and a
    zero-length `to` or `from` raised "argument is of length zero".
  * `origin` did the same across every function that resolves country names.
    It is now validated once in the shared internal, so
    `standardize_country()`, `country_join()`, `country_join_all()`,
    `join_world()`, `flow_map()`, `neighbors()`, `distance_between()`,
    `in_group()`, `repair_country_names()` and `check_country_match()` are all
    covered.
  * `attach_geometry(by = character(0))` raised "argument is of length zero".
  * `aggregate_regions(by = character(0))` raised nothing at all: it grouped by
    no columns and silently collapsed the world into a single row. `by` remains
    documented as plural, so multiple grouping columns still work.
* Logical arguments are validated too, closing the same gap in two forms. The
  `borders` argument of `world_map()` and `globe_map()` fed a bare `if ()`, so
  a bad value raised one of four opaque base R errors ("missing value where
  TRUE/FALSE needed", "argument is of length zero", "the condition has length
  > 1", "argument is not interpretable as logical") -- none naming `borders`.
  Elsewhere the value went through `isTRUE()`, which never errors but silently
  turns anything that is not `TRUE` into `FALSE`, so the caller got the
  opposite of what they asked: `rank_countries(x, v, desc = "yes")` ranked
  ascending, putting the *lowest* value at rank 1, and
  `gini(x, na.rm = "yes")` kept the `NA`s and returned `NA`. All 23 logical
  arguments across the package now require `TRUE` or `FALSE` and name
  themselves when they do not get it.
* `gini()` and `theil()` returned a wrong number for a wrong-length `weights`
  vector. Both recycled it with `rep_len()`, which accepts any length
  silently, so `gini(1:10, weights = c(1, 2))` returned `0.2902` -- computed
  from an alternating 1,2 pattern -- where the correctly-weighted answer is
  `0.3`. Someone weighting by population and mistakenly passing a vector of
  the wrong length got a plausible figure and no indication anything was
  wrong. `weights` (and `theil()`'s `groups`) must now be length 1 or the
  length of `x`, and `weights` must be numeric. `complete_years()` likewise
  rejects a `years` vector that is non-numeric, empty, or contains `NA`, all
  of which it previously coerced to `NA` behind base R's warning.
* Omitting a required argument now names it. Every affected function resolved
  its column argument with `rlang::as_name()`, which raises
  `argument "x" is missing, with no default` for a missing value -- naming
  rlang's own parameter, and none of these functions has an argument called
  `x`. `world_map()`, `tile_map()`, `facet_map()`, `spike_map()`,
  `bubble_map()`, `globe_map()`, `interactive_map()`, `rank_countries()`,
  `growth_rate()`, `per_capita()`, `aggregate_regions()`, `index_to()`,
  `share_of_world()`, `lag_by_country()`, `diff_by_country()`,
  `beta_convergence()`, `sigma_convergence()`, `morans_i()`, `world_query()`,
  `country_join()`, `bivariate_map()`, `cartogram_map()` and `flow_map()` now
  report e.g. `` `fill` is required. `` Optional tidy-eval arguments are
  unaffected.
* `distance_between()` paired the wrong countries when `a` and `b` had
  mismatched lengths. It combined them through vectorised arithmetic, so R's
  recycling applied: 2 countries against 3 returned `a[1]`-`b[1]`,
  `a[2]`-`b[2]` and `a[1]`-`b[3]`, behind only base R's "longer object length
  is not a multiple" warning, and 2 against 4 recycled cleanly with no warning
  at all. Equal lengths, or a length-1 side for one-against-many, are now
  required -- the same rule `locate_country()` has always enforced for
  `lon`/`lat`.
* Three documented contracts did not match their code: `?locate_country` said
  `lon`/`lat` were "recycled together" when the function has always required
  equal lengths, and `?gini` / `?theil` promised that `weights` was "recycled
  against `x` the usual R way", which is precisely the behaviour removed
  above. All three now describe what the functions do. `locate_country()`'s
  length error also read "or an `points` sf object".
* Offline safety is now covered by tests rather than assumed. Checks run
  `\donttest{}` examples and rebuild vignettes, and CRAN policy does not allow
  either to fail for want of a network connection. `world_data()` and
  `country_data()` degrade a failed fetch to a warning and a metadata-only
  frame, and `wdi_search()` reads `WDI`'s bundled indicator list rather than
  the API; all three are now asserted, so a change that made any of them
  require a connection would break the suite.
* An unwritable cache directory silently cost you your data.
  `memoise::cache_filesystem()` does not validate the directory it is given: it
  constructs successfully and only fails when something is *written*, which
  happens deep inside the fetch. So with a read-only or otherwise unusable
  cache location, `country_data(cache = TRUE)` reported `Could not fetch
  indicator "..." from the World Bank API` and returned the country spine with
  every indicator `NA` -- blaming the API for a local permission problem, while
  the same call with `cache = FALSE` returned the data perfectly. (The
  `tryCatch()` that was meant to fall back never fired, because constructing
  the cache never errored.) The directory is now checked before use, with a
  fallback to session-only caching and a one-time message naming the real
  cause.
* Projected maps failed outright under `options(OutDec = ",")` -- the ordinary
  setting in comma-decimal locales. The PROJ strings are built by pasting
  numbers, so `recenter = 48.9` became `+lon_0=48,9`, which PROJ rejects; the
  invalid CRS then surfaced as sf's opaque "crs not found: is it missing?".
  Every number destined for a machine-readable string is now formatted with an
  explicit decimal mark.
* Two more of the same kind, triggered by `options(scipen = -10)`, which
  formats a *double* in scientific notation: `sf::st_crs(4326)` became
  `EPSG:4.326e+03` and yielded an `NA` CRS (surfacing later as
  `st_crs(x) == st_crs(y) is not TRUE` from `locate_country()`), and Natural
  Earth's scale `110` became `1.1e+02`, so `world_geometry(geometry = "sf")`
  failed with `'countries1.1e+02' is not an exported object`. Every EPSG code
  and Natural Earth scale is now an integer literal, which `scipen` does not
  affect.
* `simplify_geometry()` and `world_geometry("graticule")` are insulated from
  two upstream bugs of the same family, both reproducible without this package:
  `rmapshaper` serialises `keep` for V8, which rejects the `0,1` that
  `options(OutDec = ",")` produces, and `sf::st_graticule()` overflows the node
  stack under `options(scipen = -10)`. Both calls now run with those two
  options normalised, and the caller's settings are restored immediately
  afterwards.
* `rank_countries()` silently ranked within groups when handed a grouped frame.
  Its `mutate()` honoured the caller's `group_by()`, so the same data ranked
  `4, 1, 3, 2` ungrouped and `2, 1, 2, 1` after an incidental
  `group_by(region)` upstream in the pipe -- with `within = NULL` in both
  cases, which documents a global ranking. `rank`, `percentile` and `z_score`
  were all affected. `within` is now the only thing that sets the ranking
  scope, matching every other function here, which imposes its own grouping
  rather than inheriting the caller's. A test asserts that a grouped input
  changes no answer, and that nothing leaks grouping into its return value.
* A non-numeric value column now errors by name instead of producing nonsense.
  A factor column is easy to acquire -- `read.csv()` on a column with one stray
  non-numeric entry gives you one -- and arithmetic on it failed four different
  ways: `growth_rate()` and `per_capita()` returned a column of `NA`s behind
  base R's "'/' not meaningful for factors"; `share_of_world()`,
  `rank_countries()` and `aggregate_regions()` raised an opaque error from
  inside `dplyr::mutate()`; `gini()` managed "missing value where TRUE/FALSE
  needed"; and `morans_i()` quietly returned a plausible-looking statistic.
  These, plus `index_to()`, `diff_by_country()`, `beta_convergence()`,
  `sigma_convergence()` and `theil()`, now name the column and its actual type.
  `lag_by_country()` is deliberately unchanged: it does no arithmetic, so
  lagging a factor or character column remains legitimate.
* `aggregate_regions()` reported a figure for groups it had no data for. Values
  are dropped before aggregating, so a group whose every value is missing had
  nothing left -- and each base function got that wrong differently: `"sum"`
  returned `0`, `"mean"` and `"weighted_mean"` `NaN`, and `"min"`/`"max"`
  `-Inf`/`Inf` plus a warning. "This region's total is 0" is a claim, not an
  absence, which matters in a package built around honest missing-data
  handling. All six now return `NA`, as `"min"`/`"max"` were already meant to;
  groups that do have data are unaffected, and a partially-missing group still
  aggregates the values it has. `?aggregate_regions` documents this.
* `complete_years()` failed on a zero-row panel, where every other panel helper
  returns zero rows. With no `years` it reached
  `seq(min(numeric(0)), max(numeric(0)))` and died on base R's "'from' must be
  a finite number"; with `years` supplied it died on tidyr's "Can't recycle
  `year` (size 3) to size 0". Neither message names anything the caller did. It
  now returns the empty frame, columns intact, for all three `method` values --
  while still reporting a bad `years` or `value` argument.
* `bivariate_map()` and `cartogram_map()` (and so `dorling_map()`) failed
  inside their optional dependency when no row carried the values they need.
  This is easier to hit than it sounds: `attach_geometry()` joins
  geometry-on-the-left, so a frame with nothing in it arrives at the plotting
  verb as full-length columns of `NA`. `biscale` then indexed
  `sVar[1:(length(sVar) - 1)]`, which becomes `1:-1`, and reported "only 0's
  may be mixed with negative subscripts"; `cartogram` compared `NA` in
  `if (meanSizeError < maxSizeError)` and reported "missing value where
  TRUE/FALSE needed". Neither mentions the data. Both now say which columns are
  empty, as `spike_map()` already did, and both reject a non-numeric column by
  name. Partly-missing columns still draw from the rows that do have values.
* `gini()` could kill the R session. It computed the weighted mean absolute
  difference with `outer()`, an n-by-n matrix -- fine for the ~200 countries it
  is written for, but it is exported and accepts any numeric vector. A
  geometry-joined column is 99,338 rows, needing about 79 GB, and the process
  was killed outright: no error, no message, no result. The kernel is now the
  sorted cumulative form, O(n log n) in time and O(n) in memory, which agrees
  with the pairwise definition to floating-point noise (verified across ties,
  zero weights, single values and 340 random cases) and handles a million
  values in well under a second. Every documented figure is unchanged.
* `aggregate_regions()` silently multiplied its answer when given a frame with
  map geometry attached. The polygon backend expands each country into hundreds
  of vertex rows, so a row-wise total counts it once per vertex: for the bundled
  snapshot a regional total of 497,265 came out as 280,951,373. It is reachable
  directly off `world_data(geometry = "polygon")`. It cannot de-duplicate on
  `iso3c`, since `by = c("region", "year")` roll-ups legitimately repeat a
  country, so it now warns and says what to do instead. Country-level tables
  and panels are unaffected.
* `?audit_coverage` described the raw list it returns without mentioning that
  the object is classed and has a `print()` method, so what you actually see at
  the console is a formatted report rather than the list. Both are now
  documented.
* `world_geometry("ocean")` drew nothing at all, in every projection. Under the
  S2 engine -- sf's default since 1.0, so everywhere --
  `st_as_sfc(st_bbox(-180, -90, 180, 90))` collapses to a two-point, zero-area
  polygon, and the collapse is invisible because `st_bbox()` reports the stored
  extent instead of recomputing it from the (empty) coordinates. The rectangle
  is now built by constructing the ring explicitly, which S2 never gets to
  reinterpret, and its edges are densified so a curved projection has points
  to bend: the layer comes out at Earth's true surface area (5.1e14 m2) and
  covers 98-100% of the countries layer across all nine world projections.
  `st_break_antimeridian()` is no longer applied here at all -- with
  `lon_0 = 0` it cut the outline at +/-180, its own edges, taking it down to two
  thirds of the globe and, under Mollweide, to nothing.
* Where an ocean background cannot be drawn, `world_geometry()` now says so
  instead of returning an invisible layer: the four hemispheric projections
  (`"orthographic"`, `"azimuthal_equal_area"`, `"north_polar"`,
  `"south_polar"`) show half the globe, and a whole-globe rectangle cannot be
  recentred without covering only part of the map.
* `world_geometry("coastline")` and `world_geometry("ocean")` returned a bare
  `sfc` rather than the `sf` object `?world_geometry` promises (and that the
  other four `what` values deliver), so dplyr verbs failed on exactly those
  two. Both are now `sf`; the geometry is unchanged.
* `?world_geometry`'s `@return` was a single line naming no columns. It now
  lists what each `what` returns, and warns that the sf backend's
  `centroid_lon`/`centroid_lat` are in the object's own CRS -- projected metres,
  not degrees, so `centroid_lon` for France is `174097`, not `2.1`. Use
  `country_meta$centroid_lon` for degrees.
* `sf::st_coordinates()` failed on `world_geometry("countries", geometry =
  "sf")`, in every projection including the default. Natural Earth supplies 177
  uniform `MULTIPOLYGON`s, but `st_break_antimeridian()` runs an
  `st_intersection()` internally that collapses a single-part `MULTIPOLYGON` to
  a `POLYGON`, leaving 148 `POLYGON` + 29 `MULTIPOLYGON` -- an `sfc_GEOMETRY`
  column, which `st_coordinates()` does not support. Extracting vertices from
  the package's own geometry, an ordinary thing to want, therefore errored with
  "not implemented for objects of class sfc_GEOMETRY". The column is cast back
  to `MULTIPOLYGON`, which is a type change only: row count, codes and land
  area are unchanged. `?world_geometry` also now notes that a hemispheric
  projection returns empty geometries for the far side, where the same
  `st_coordinates()` limitation applies for a different and correct reason.
* `world_map()` accepted a frame with no geometry, returned a `ggplot` object
  without complaint, and then failed only when the plot was printed -- with
  ggplot2's "Problem while computing aesthetics ... Caused by error in
  `.data$long`", which names nothing the caller did. It validated the `fill`
  column but never the `long`/`lat`/`group` columns the polygon path needs.
  Forgetting `attach_geometry()` is the easiest mistake to make here, and it is
  easy precisely because the other plotting verbs do not need it:
  `tile_map()`, `bubble_map()`, `spike_map()` and `globe_map()` all take a
  country-level frame, so `world_map(snap, gdp)` looks like it should work too.
  It now says so at the call, and names the fix. `facet_map()` delegates to
  `world_map()` and is covered by the same check; the four country-level verbs
  are deliberately unchanged, and a test pins that asymmetry.
* `interactive_map(engine = "ggiraph")` reported a missing geometry differently
  from the other engines. It assembles its own `ggplot` rather than calling
  `world_map()`, so it bypassed that check and failed at render time on
  `.data$long`, while `engine = "plotly"` named the problem properly. Both now
  give the same message. `?interactive_map` also documents that the `"leaflet"`
  engine attaches geometry itself if handed a country-level table, which the
  others do not.
* The numeric fill styles now require a numeric column. `style = "continuous"`
  and `"binned"` reached ggplot2 and failed only when the plot was printed
  ("Discrete value supplied to a continuous scale", "Binned scales only support
  continuous data"), neither naming the column; `"quantile"` and `"jenks"` did
  not fail at all -- the break computation returns early on a non-numeric
  column, so the fill fell through to the discrete scale and drew a plausible
  map whose legend claimed quantile bins it had never computed. The reverse
  direction, `style = "categorical"` on a numeric column, was already guarded,
  so this closes the pair. `animate_world()` and `facet_map()` inherit it.
* `attach_geometry()` no longer warns when given a panel. Joining one row per
  country-year against polygon vertices is legitimately many-to-many -- it is
  what `animate_world()` and `facet_map()` are for -- so dplyr's "unexpected
  many-to-many relationship" warning was noise. The relationship is now
  declared, as the cache merge already did.
* `?repair_country_names` now says which way the `stringdist` fallback errs.
  The `threshold` argument already noted that the metric changes when
  `stringdist` is absent (Jaro-Winkler versus a length-normalised edit
  distance); it now adds that the fallback is the more conservative of the two,
  repairing a subset of what Jaro-Winkler would -- mainly missing transposed
  letters, as in "Frnace" -- and never choosing a different country. Measured
  over 120 single-typo names: 98 repaired with `stringdist`, 77 without, none
  repaired that `stringdist` did not, and no wrong repairs either way. A test
  now holds the package to that.
* `simplify_geometry()` undid the geometry-type fix above. Both simplifiers
  collapse a single-part `MULTIPOLYGON` to a `POLYGON`, so a homogeneous input
  came back as a mixed `sfc_GEOMETRY` column and `sf::st_coordinates()` failed
  on the result -- the same defect as `world_geometry("countries")`, restored
  one step downstream. The output is cast back; row count and geometry are
  unchanged.
* `simplify_geometry()`'s `keep` argument now means roughly the same thing with
  and without `rmapshaper`. The `sf::st_simplify()` fallback was given a fixed
  `dTolerance` of `(1 - keep) * 10000`, i.e. metres whatever the coordinate
  system: 9 km on a projected frame, which barely simplified anything (79% of
  vertices kept at `keep = 0.1`), and 9000 *degrees* on a lon/lat frame, which
  is meaningless and only survivable because `preserveTopology` keeps a husk.
  The tolerance is now scaled to the object's own extent, so the fallback
  behaves the same on either coordinate system and responds monotonically to
  `keep`. `?simplify_geometry` says that only `rmapshaper` honours `keep` as a
  true proportion.
* `gini()`'s negative-value warning said `Returning "NA"`, which reads as the
  two-character string rather than the missing value. It now renders as `NA`,
  matching the same correction already made elsewhere.
* The test suite no longer fails on R >= 4.6. Several tests set
  `options(scipen = -10)` to exercise the scientific-notation bugs fixed above,
  but R 4.6 clamps `scipen` to a minimum of -9 and warns ("invalid 'scipen'
  -10, used -9"), so an exact round-trip assertion failed and three warnings
  were raised -- an `ERROR` under `R CMD check` on current R, even though the
  package code itself was correct. The tests now use -9 and compare against the
  value R actually stored.
* The `wdj_overrides()` soft-deprecation notice told the wrong people. It lived
  in the shared function body, so in an interactive session it fired for
  `country_overrides()` -- the very replacement it recommends -- and for every
  public function that takes the override table as a default argument
  (`standardize_country()`, `convert_country()`, `attach_geometry()`,
  `check_country_match()`, `repair_country_names()`, `world_data()` and the
  geometry backends). Callers were advised to stop using a function they had
  never written, and the advice was unactionable. The notice now fires only for
  a direct call to `wdj_overrides()`; the table itself is unchanged. The
  documented default is now `country_overrides()`, so `?attach_geometry` and
  friends name a function the reader can actually look up.
* `?country_borders`'s whole-world example runs again. It was wrapped in
  `\dontrun{}` on the grounds that the whole-world adjacency is expensive, but
  it takes about a quarter of a second from a cold session -- only 2.7 times
  the `region = "Europe"` subset that already ran live. CRAN discourages
  `\dontrun{}` for code that can be executed, so it is now a guarded
  `\donttest{}` and is actually exercised by the check. That leaves six
  `\dontrun{}` topics, each genuinely unrunnable: a live World Bank fetch, an
  HTML widget, a DuckDB connection, a 60-frame GIF, and a call that deletes
  files.
* `?country_overrides`'s advice for accented names in a non-UTF-8 locale did
  not work in that locale. It offered de-accenting with
  `iconv(x, to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")` as an alternative to running under UTF-8,
  but `//TRANSLIT` is itself locale-dependent: under `LC_CTYPE=C` it returns
  `NA`, or replaces each accent with `?` when given an explicit
  `from = "UTF-8"`, so nothing resolves either way. The section now says
  de-accenting has to happen while still in a UTF-8 locale, and that the ASCII
  spellings the override table carries are what work everywhere.
* A bad `options(countryatlas.workers)` reached `mclapply()`. The option is
  advertised in this file, so a stray value is reachable: `"abc"`, `NA` and
  `Inf` all became `NA` workers and surfaced as "missing value where
  TRUE/FALSE needed" from deep inside a parallel fetch, while `c(2, 4)`
  silently used the larger of the two. It is now checked, and the message names
  the option. Values below one are still clamped to one, as before -- that path
  was never the problem.
* A bad `options(countryatlas.cache_dir)` did the same thing one layer down.
  The option is documented in `?clear_wdi_cache`, and a stray value reached
  `dir.exists()`/`dir.create()`: `NA`, a number and `TRUE` each gave "invalid
  filename argument", `character(0)` gave "argument is of length zero", and a
  two-element vector gave "the condition has length > 1". It is now checked and
  the message names the option. An empty string is still accepted and still
  degrades to session-only caching; `NA_character_`, which used to degrade
  silently, now errors like the other bad values.
* An empty cache directory failed on R 4.6 but not on R 4.4. `dir.create("")`
  warns and returns `FALSE` on R 4.4, so the fallback to session-only caching
  worked; on R 4.6 it *errors* with "zero-length 'path' argument", which
  escaped the surrounding `suppressWarnings()` and propagated. An empty path is
  now recognised as "no disk cache" before the filesystem is touched, so the
  behaviour is the same on every R version.
* `?theil` now says that a row with a missing *group* is dropped along with rows
  whose value is missing, so the decomposition's `total` is computed over the
  grouped subset and can differ from the ungrouped `theil(x)`. On the bundled
  snapshot that difference is entirely Puerto Rico, which has no `region`.
  `theil()` also gains numeric anchors on the bundled data, which `gini()`
  already had.
* Every `sf`-backed verb leaked `sf`'s internal chatter as `message()`
  conditions. The console was already clean, but silencing it by redirecting the
  message *stream* leaves the conditions themselves travelling to whatever
  handler the caller installed, so `purrr::quietly()`, `testthat::expect_silent()`
  or a plain `withCallingHandlers()` around `attach_geometry()`, `neighbors()`,
  `country_borders()`, `locate_country()` or `morans_i()` still saw three to nine
  "Spherical geometry (s2) switched off" / "assumes that they are planar"
  notices. They are now muffled as well as redirected. (The comment claiming
  these notices bypass R's condition system was simply wrong -- they are
  ordinary `message()`s, and only a few GDAL diagnostics need the stream
  redirect.)
* `?world_geometry` called all four azimuthal projections "hemispheric" and said
  the far side comes back as empty geometries. That is true of `"orthographic"`
  alone; `"azimuthal_equal_area"`, `"north_polar"` and `"south_polar"` are
  Lambert equal-area and image the *whole* globe, with the far side stretched
  around the rim and nothing dropped. The page now distinguishes them and points
  at `region` for a genuine polar view, and the error `"ocean"` raises in those
  projections no longer gives "it shows one hemisphere" as the reason.
* `?world_geometry` now documents the Natural Earth features that have no ISO
  code and so come back with `iso3c` `NA` -- Somaliland at every scale, plus the
  Indian Ocean Territories and Ashmore and Cartier Islands from `"medium"` on.
* `?theme_world_map` said the theme is used by *all* the package's plotting
  functions. `bivariate_map()` is the exception -- it applies
  `biscale::bi_theme()` so the map matches biscale's own legend, and its axis
  titles, panel grid and background differ as a result. The page now names the
  exception.
* `?simplify_geometry` documented `keep` as a proportion "(0-1)", but `keep = 0`
  is rejected on both simplifier paths (it would leave nothing to draw). The
  range now reads "greater than 0 and at most 1".
* `complete_years(value = )` fabricated data in the columns it was *not* given.
  A numeric column left out of `value` was classified as a static attribute and
  carry-filled, so naming **fewer** columns invented **more** figures -- and even
  `method = "none"`, which exists to complete the grid and fill nothing, produced
  a carried-forward value for the missing year. Measure columns are now excluded
  from the attribute carry whether or not they are named; an unnamed one stays
  `NA` in the rows `complete()` adds. `value = NULL` behaves exactly as before.
* `aggregate_regions()` silently ignored `weight` for every `fun` except
  `"weighted_mean"`, returning the unweighted figure -- on European GDP per
  capita, 38,323 where the population-weighted answer is 29,896. Passing
  `weight` with any other `fun` now errors, mirroring the existing abort when
  `fun = "weighted_mean"` is given no weight.
* `flow_map()` dropped a flow whose endpoint it could not resolve without a
  word, and when nothing resolved it returned a bare world map with no arc
  layer at all. It now warns, naming the values it could not place and pointing
  at `origin` -- feeding it `iso3c` codes while `origin` still defaults to
  `"country.name"` is the usual cause, and it drew a blank map.
* `?in_group` now says that a value `origin` cannot resolve answers `FALSE`,
  indistinguishable from a country that is genuinely outside the group, and
  points at `check_country_match()` for telling the two apart.
* `world_map()` / `globe_map()` passed `palette`, `title`, `legend` and
  `na_label` to `viridisLite` and `ggplot2` unchecked, so a mistake came back in
  their vocabulary rather than the package's: `palette = c("magma", "viridis")`
  reached a bare `switch()` and reported "EXPR must be a length 1 vector", and a
  numeric `palette` was accepted without a word. A length-2 `title` or `legend`
  was accepted too, and `ggplot2` then drew both strings on top of each other.
  All four are now checked; `world_query()` already validated the two of them it
  takes (`palette` and `title`). `na_label` keeps its documented tolerance --
  there is one `NA` key, so the first element wins and a length-1 `NA` still
  means "leave the default formatter alone" -- but it now says so instead of
  doing it silently. A number is still a perfectly good *label*.
* `country_data()` / `world_data()` resolved a conflict between `latest` and the
  shape arguments silently, and with opposite precedence depending on the year:
  a multi-year `year` overrode `latest = TRUE`, while a single year had
  `latest = TRUE` override `panel = TRUE`. The winner is unchanged -- both were
  already the documented behaviour -- but the call now warns, naming the
  argument being dropped, instead of returning a shape nobody asked for.
* `locate_country(tolerance_km = )` was unvalidated, and a character value did
  not merely give an opaque message -- it produced a **wrong answer**. R compares
  `dkm <= tolerance_km` as strings when the tolerance is character, and
  `"2650" <= "a"` is `TRUE`, so every unmatched point snapped to its nearest
  country however far away it was: a mid-Pacific point came back as Fiji, where
  the documented behaviour is that open ocean stays `NA`. Now checked, before the
  `sf` gate.
* Three more scalars the validation sweep had missed now name themselves instead
  of failing in a dependency's vocabulary: `correlate_indicators(min_n = )` (an
  `NA` gave "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed", a length-2 value "the
  condition has length > 1"), and `dorling_map(k = )` / `dorling_map(itermax = )`
  (which reported `cartogram`'s "all sizes are missing and/or non-positive" and
  an assertion naming its internal `maxiter`).
* `interactive_map(engine = "ggsql")` reported a missing `ggsql` >= 0.4.1 for a
  frame that simply had no geometry -- sending the caller after a package that
  has not shipped in the R bindings at all, only to meet the real error
  afterwards. The `sf` check now runs ahead of the package gates.
  `spin_globe()` had the same inversion for its `fill` column: its scalars were
  moved ahead of the animation gate in an earlier pass, but the column check was
  not, so a mistyped column still asked for `gifski`.
* `join_world()` could not read a column of ISO codes without being told to.
  Its fallback detector tried each character column with
  `origin = "country.name"`, which does not match most alpha-3 codes, so a
  column of them was rejected outright -- and a column *named* `iso3c` was found
  by name but still read as country names, so
  `join_world(tibble(iso3c = c("FRA", "JPN")))` warned that nothing matched and
  returned all `NA`. Detection now tries the code schemes as well and carries
  the one that worked through to the conversion, so `iso3c`, `iso_a3`, `iso2c`
  and an unrecognised name like `code` all resolve. An explicit `origin` still
  wins, and a column whose name implies a scheme is only read that way if the
  scheme actually resolves it.
* A bounding-box `region` on the **polygon** backend only filters vertices; it
  cannot clip a polygon, so a country crossing the edge keeps a truncated ring
  that `geom_polygon()` closes with a straight chord (France loses 202 of 605
  vertices and the two ends sit 15 degrees apart). Nothing in the returned
  tibble showed it, and the vignette presented the box as clipping the shapes.
  It now warns and points at `geometry = "sf"`, where the clip is a real
  `sf::st_crop()`; `?world_geometry` and the vignette say which is which.
* `attach_geometry()` on a frame that already had geometry multiplied the rows
  instead of refusing. The join is by country, and a polygon frame holds one row
  per *vertex*, so re-attaching joins a country's vertices against themselves:
  the bundled snapshot went from 99,338 rows to **310,977,360**. The call
  declares `relationship = "many-to-many"` -- correctly, since one country really
  does have many vertices -- which switches off dplyr's own guard against
  exactly this. It now errors, and says to pass the country-level table.
* `share_of_world()` on a grouped frame with no `year` column returned a share
  of the **group**, not of the world: `sum()` inside `mutate()` is per group, so
  a frame grouped by continent came back with a column that summed to 5 instead
  of 1, under a name and a help page that both say "world". A panel was already
  safe by accident, because the function regroups by `year` and that replaces the
  caller's groups. It now ignores the grouping in both cases, and says so where
  it would have mattered.
* The verbs that add a column now say when they replace one the caller already
  had. `rank_countries()` overwrote `rank`, `percentile` and `z_score`, and
  `per_capita()`, `share_of_world()`, `growth_rate()`, `index_to()`,
  `lag_by_country()` and `diff_by_country()` overwrote their target column, all
  in silence -- a user's own `rank` column simply vanished. It is a warning, not
  an error, because re-running a verb on its own output is legitimate.
  `standardize_country()` is deliberately exempt: `add` names the columns
  literally, so replacing an existing `continent` is what was asked for.
* `geom_country_labels()` on an `sf` map failed with `rlang`'s internal
  "Column `long` not found in `.data`". The layer reads the polygon backend's
  `long`/`lat` columns, and its own `aes()` was evaluated against the sf frame
  before the guard inside could run. It now errors with its own message and
  points at `ggplot2::geom_sf_text(aes(label = iso3c))`, which is documented on
  the help page too.
* `geom_country_labels()` put every country that crosses the antimeridian on the
  far side of the planet when the frame had no `group` column. `group` is what
  identifies a country's separate pieces, and the label belongs on the largest;
  without it the fallback averaged the raw longitude range, so measured against
  the largest-piece centroid Fiji was 177.8 degrees out, New Zealand 169.6, and
  even the USA 96.6 -- its Aleutian tail dragging the mid-range to the Gulf of
  Guinea. Averaging in wrapped coordinates cuts those to 0.2, 6.9 and 31.4. It
  remains an approximation, and the help page now says that placement is exact
  only while `group` is present.

## Housekeeping

* `gini()` and `theil()` returned a silent `NaN` when the input contained an
  infinity. `Inf` is not `NA`, so it passed `na.rm` and (for Theil) the
  non-positive filter, then made the mean infinite and every share `Inf/Inf`.
  Every other verb propagates an infinity visibly -- `Inf` in, `Inf` out, which
  the caller can see -- but an inequality index has no such value to report, so
  both now warn and return `NA`, as they already did for a zero total weight.
  Infinite `weights` are caught too. `NaN` is still treated as `NA` and dropped.
* `?theil` promised a tibble whenever `groups` is supplied, but every degenerate
  path -- nothing left after `na.rm`, a zero total weight, an infinity -- returns
  a single `NA` instead. The help page now says so.
* `dorling_map(k = 0)` passed validation and then failed inside `cartogram` with
  "all sizes are missing and/or non-positive". `check_number()`'s bounds are
  inclusive, so `lo = 0` admitted a value the next layer cannot use -- the same
  hole the integer ceilings were added to close, at the other end of the range.
  It is now rejected with a message naming `k`; anything above zero still works.
* `?countryatlas` gains an **Options** section. Two of the three options the
  package reads -- `countryatlas.workers` and `countryatlas.gdp_compat` -- were
  described only in this changelog, which is not reference documentation, so a
  reader of the help pages had no way to find them. (`wdj_workers()`'s own
  comment noted that the option was "advertised in NEWS", which is how a bad
  value became reachable.) All three are now documented where they are looked
  for, and a test fails if a future option is read without being listed.
* The test suite runs in a quarter of the time (`R CMD check`'s test phase went
  from 389s to 92s). One block asked `neighbors()` for each country in turn and
  then again for each of that country's neighbours, to confirm the reverse edge
  -- and `neighbors()` recomputes the whole world's `sf::st_touches()` adjacency
  on every call, so that was ~465 rebuilds and 292 seconds, four fifths of the
  suite. `neighbors()` is vectorised, so one call does the same work. The same
  properties are asserted (irreflexive, no repeated pair, every edge symmetric),
  and a failure now names the offending countries rather than only counting
  them.
* `?neighbors` now says to pass a vector rather than loop, since that cost is
  invisible from the outside: every call rebuilds the whole world's adjacency, so
  asking about one country costs the same as asking about all of them, and adding
  countries to a single call only adds the filtering. Measured here, one country
  takes about as long as 153 of them, which makes a loop over them roughly two
  orders of magnitude more work. The note names `country_borders()` as where the
  cost comes from. A test pins the fact the advice rests on -- one
  `country_borders()` call per `neighbors()` call, whatever the length of `x`.
* `?attach_geometry` claimed that Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Macao, Tuvalu and the
  British Virgin Islands have geometry in "no backend at any scale". Only
  Gibraltar does not: the other four are carried by the `sf` backend at
  `scale = "medium"`, which is the very fix the preceding sentence recommends for
  microstates. It was the *no-tile* list from `?world_tiles` -- coincidentally the
  same five names -- pasted into a paragraph about geometry. Corrected, and the
  section's coverage counts (215 snapshot countries; 210, 169 and 214 carried)
  are now pinned by a test, so an upstream Natural Earth change surfaces as a
  failure rather than as silently wrong advice.
* `as_ggsql_source(format = "parquet")` wrote into the **working directory** when
  no `path` was given: the default was the bare relative path
  `"<name>.parquet"`. CRAN policy is that a package writes nowhere but the
  session's temporary directory unless the caller says otherwise. The default is
  now a file of that name under `tempdir()`, and since the function returns the
  path the workflow is unchanged; an explicit `path` still writes exactly where
  you point it. `spin_globe()` already defaulted to `tempfile()`, and no other
  export writes at all.
* `?country_meta` and `?world_snapshot` now say that their `country` columns
  disagree, and why. `country_meta` carries `countrycode`'s English names and
  `world_snapshot` the World Bank's, so 38 of the 215 shared countries are
  labelled differently ("South Korea" against "Korea, Rep."). Each table is
  faithful to its own source and neither is wrong, but joining the two on
  `iso3c` leaves you holding two `country` columns with nothing to explain the
  difference -- the very reconciliation `country_join()` advertises, using the
  same example. The count is pinned by a test, along with the referential
  consistency of all five code columns against `country_meta`.
* `?world_data` and `?country_data` now say where the `country` label comes
  from, because the same call produces two different spellings: a successful
  fetch carries the World Bank's names ("Korea, Rep."), while the country spine
  used when the fetch returns nothing carries the `countrycode` names ("South
  Korea") -- as does every other function in the package. Nothing can reconcile
  that offline, since the World Bank spelling only exists in the response, so
  both pages now point at `iso3c` as the stable key and at
  `convert_country(iso3c, to = "country")` for one consistent set of labels.
* `utils::globalVariables()` declared 29 names where 7 are needed. Emptying it
  and reading what `R CMD check` actually reports showed the rest were covered by
  the `.data$x` idiom the code uses throughout, which needs no declaration at
  all; three of them (`subregion`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, `gdp_per_capita_2015`) never
  appeared as bare symbols anywhere, only in a comment or as string literals. A
  stale entry is worse than clutter: it silences the "no visible binding" NOTE
  for a *new* bare use of the same name, which is the warning that would
  otherwise catch a typo. A test now fails if a declared name is not a real bare
  symbol in `R/`.
* Six exported functions failed when the package was loaded but not attached --
  `countryatlas::dissolve_country()`, `distance_between()`, `country_groups()`,
  `in_group()`, `tile_map()` and `world_geometry(region = <group name>)` all died
  with "object 'historical_codes' not found" or similar. They referred to the
  bundled datasets by bare name, and a bare name resolves only while the package
  is on the search path: under `countryatlas::fn()` in a script with no
  `library()` call, the lazy-data objects are not reachable. They are now
  `countryatlas::`-qualified. Every test in the suite attaches the package, so
  nothing caught this; a static check now fails if a bare reference reappears.
* `per_capita()` failed when the caller's frame already had a column named
  `.wdj_pop`, the internal name used for the fetched population. The join
  suffixed both sides to `.wdj_pop.x` / `.wdj_pop.y`, so the column the division
  reads came back `NULL` and base R reported "replacement has 0 rows, data has
  2". Any pre-existing column of that name is now dropped before the join. Only
  the branch that fetches population was affected -- passing `pop` explicitly
  never touched it.
* Two verbs leaked someone else's message on an empty frame. `facet_map()` gave
  `ggplot2`'s "Faceting variables must have at least one value", which names
  neither the argument nor the package; it now says the frame has no rows to
  facet, and notes that the other map verbs draw an empty panel instead.
  `geom_country_labels()` ran the centroid summary over nothing, where `range()`
  warns twice and `dplyr` adds a deprecation note on top -- it now returns early,
  silent as it is on a full frame. Every other plotting verb already handled a
  zero-row frame cleanly, either drawing an empty panel or naming the reason it
  cannot.
* `?attach_geometry` now says that geometry is attached once **per row**, not
  once per country. A panel wants exactly that -- one row per country-year, each
  carrying the shape -- but a frame that repeats a country by accident draws it
  more than once, and only the last one painted is visible. dplyr's own
  many-to-many warning is suppressed by the relationship the join declares, so
  nothing signals it.
* `?country_data`'s example quoted a **retired** World Bank indicator. The bank
  replaced the `EN.ATM.CO2E.*` carbon series with the AR5 greenhouse-gas series,
  and the bundled `common_indicators` table had already been updated, but the
  example still asked for `EN.ATM.CO2E.KT` -- so anyone copying it got a warning
  and an all-`NA` column. It now uses `EN.GHG.CO2.MT.CE.AR5`, which returns data.
  `R CMD check` reports examples "OK" without failing on the warning, so nothing
  surfaced this; a test now checks every indicator code quoted in `R/`, `man/`
  or the vignettes against the bundled table.
* `country_groups_tbl` was out of date by two years in four places, while
  carrying an `as_of` stamp of 2026-06-01 that claimed otherwise. **Sweden was
  missing from NATO** (acceded 7 March 2024; Finland had been added, so the table
  had been maintained to 2023 and no further), **Angola was still in OPEC** (left
  1 January 2024), **BRICS still held only its original five** (Egypt, Ethiopia,
  Iran and the UAE joined in January 2024, Indonesia in January 2025), and **The
  Gambia was missing from the Commonwealth** (rejoined 2018). Corrected, so the
  counts are now NATO 32, OPEC 12, BRICS 10 and Commonwealth 56. Saudi Arabia is
  deliberately still absent from BRICS: it was invited in the 2024 round but has
  never confirmed accession. `in_group("Sweden", "NATO")` returned `FALSE` before
  this.
* `options(countryatlas.cache_dir = )` was ignored once a cached fetch had
  happened. The memoised fetcher was built on first use and kept for the rest of
  the session, so relocating the cache afterwards silently kept writing to the
  original directory -- and `?clear_wdi_cache` offers that option as the way to
  relocate the cache without saying it has to be set first. It only ever took
  effect because `clear_wdi_cache()` happened to reset the state. The fetcher is
  now rebuilt when the directory changes, and the "cannot write to the cache
  directory" notice is once per *directory* rather than once per session, so a
  second unwritable location is not swallowed.
* A corrupt cache entry was reported as a World Bank outage. An interrupted write
  leaves a truncated or empty `.rds`, and `readRDS()`'s "unknown input format"
  surfaced under "Could not fetch indicator ... from the World Bank API", sending
  the caller off to debug a connection that was fine -- the same misattribution
  already fixed for an unwritable cache *directory*, now fixed on the read side.
  The warning names the cache and gives the recovery command, which matters
  because the bad entry persists: every later call degrades to the country spine
  until `clear_wdi_cache(disk = TRUE)` is run. A genuine network failure still
  blames the network.
* When the cache directory was unwritable, caching stopped working altogether
  instead of falling back to the session. The in-memory memo that stands in for
  the disk cache lives in one process, but multiple indicators are fetched with
  `parallel::mclapply()`, so each worker warmed a memo and then exited with it:
  every call re-fetched every indicator, hitting the World Bank API again and
  again with nothing to show for it. Fetching is now serial when the memo is
  memory-only -- the repeated round-trips cost far more than the one-shot
  parallel speedup -- and unchanged when the disk cache is available, since a
  disk memo is shared by every worker.
* A failed indicator was dropped from the result without a word, whenever more
  than one indicator was requested. `fetch_one_safe()` degrades gracefully and
  warns -- "Could not fetch indicator ... from the World Bank API", or the
  corrupt-cache variant -- but it runs inside `parallel::mclapply()`, which
  brings back a worker's *value* and discards the conditions it signalled. Since
  having several indicators is exactly what makes the fetch fork, and
  `parallel = TRUE` is the default, the common case was the silent one: a column
  simply missing from the table with no explanation. A single indicator, which
  never forks, warned correctly -- which is why this went unnoticed. Conditions
  are now carried back and re-signalled in the calling process, on the serial
  path too so both report identically, and one problem is reported once even if
  two entries name the same series.
* Country lookups silently returned `NA` in Turkish, Azeri and Crimean Tatar
  locales. `toupper()` and `tolower()` follow `LC_CTYPE`, and in those locales
  `i` and `I` are not a case pair: `toupper("idn")` returns a *dotted* capital
  I, not `"IDN"`, and `tolower("ISO3C")` returns a *dotless* i. Five places
  folded an ASCII identifier that way and then compared it against plain ASCII,
  so every ISO code containing an `i` (IDN, IND, IRL, IRN, ISL, ISR, ITA, BIH,
  CIV, FIN, ...) failed to resolve. The failures were quiet and the blast radius
  uneven: `world_geometry(region = c("ind", "chn"))` returned Ivory Coast,
  Indonesia, Isle of Man and India -- one unfoldable element made the whole
  vector fall through to *name* matching, which then matched on substrings;
  `dissolve_country("SOUTH VIETNAM")` stopped finding its alias; and
  `join_world()` on a frame with `ISO3C` and `geo` columns picked `geo`, joining
  on the wrong column entirely. Identifier folding is now done with an explicit
  ASCII table (`ascii_upper()` / `ascii_lower()`) and does not consult the
  locale.

  This fixes countryatlas's own folding, which covers every path keyed on an ISO
  code, a column name or an alias. It cannot fix matching on a country *name*:
  that goes through `countrycode`, whose regexes are themselves locale-sensitive
  (`countrycode("Ireland", "country.name", "iso3c")` is `NA` under `tr_TR`). So
  a user with `LC_COLLATE=tr_TR` still sees name-keyed gaps -- notably the
  polygon backend, which labels its geometry by joining region *names* to codes,
  so `world_geometry(region = "IND")` comes back with 21 rows of Siachen Glacier
  instead of India. Working around that would mean forcing the C locale around
  every `countrycode` call, which risks mangling accented names for everyone
  else; it is left for upstream.
* The two-core cap that CRAN policy requires of a check was applied only when
  `_R_CHECK_LIMIT_CORES_` held the exact string `"TRUE"`. `R CMD check
  --as-cran` does set it to that -- but only when it is not already set, so the
  value that actually arrives is whatever the check flavour or CI exported, and
  R's own parser for these variables reads `"true"`, `"True"`, `"T"`, `"1"`,
  `"yes"`, `"Yes"` and `"YES"` as true as well. Under any of those spellings the
  cap did not apply and a multi-indicator fetch forked `detectCores() - 1`
  workers in the middle of a check. The test is now inverted: a value that is
  set and does not explicitly parse as false means "limit", which also covers
  `"warn"`. An explicit `"false"`, `"F"`, `"0"` or `"no"` is still honoured as a
  deliberate opt-out.
* `?world_data`'s example called `world_data(2020)` unconditionally, and the
  default `geometry = "polygon"` backend comes from the suggested `maps`
  package. `R CMD check` runs `\donttest{}` blocks, so on a check flavour
  configured without suggested packages -- CRAN runs one -- that example failed
  with "The package \"maps\" is required for the polygon geometry backend",
  taking the whole examples step down with it. Writing R Extensions requires
  code that uses a suggested package to be conditional, examples included; the
  call is now guarded with `requireNamespace("maps")`. The second call in the
  block passes `geometry = "none"` and needs nothing beyond the hard
  dependencies, so it is left to run unconditionally.
* The `beyond-the-choropleth` vignette failed to build wherever `rnaturalearth`
  was absent. Its chunk guard was `has_sf <- requireNamespace("sf")`, but the sf
  geometry backend gates on three packages -- `sf`, `rnaturalearth` and
  `rnaturalearthdata` -- so on a machine with sf but without the Natural Earth
  data the guarded chunk evaluated to `TRUE`, ran, and stopped `R CMD build`
  with "The packages \"rnaturalearth\" and \"rnaturalearthdata\" are required
  for the sf geometry backend". The other two vignettes already tested for
  `rnaturalearth`; all three now test for the same trio the code itself gates
  on. Three tests had the same incomplete guard and errored rather than
  skipping in that configuration; they now share a `skip_if_no_sf_geometry()`
  helper.
* New hex logo, drawn by the package itself (`data-raw/hex_logo.R`): an
  orthographic globe (`globe_map()`'s projection) carrying a viridis
  choropleth of `world_snapshot` GDP per capita on Natural Earth geometry
  joined by `attach_geometry()`, with `spike_map()`-style population spikes
  rising off the horizon and the binned-legend swatches under the wordmark.
* The `gdp_per_capita_2015` compatibility alias (a one-cycle deprecation shim
  from 1.0.0) is now opt-in: set `options(countryatlas.gdp_compat = TRUE)` to
  restore it. The default is `FALSE`, so `world_data()` no longer emits a
  duplicate column.
* `world_snapshot` refreshed to year **2024** (was 2022) and rebuilt with the
  latest WDI data and curated overrides.
* `country_groups_tbl` membership date bumped to 2026-06-01 (was 2024-01-01).
* `?world_snapshot` was out of sync with the rebuilt data (missing the
  "Snapshot year: 2024" note); regenerated.
* Fixed a stray orphaned code fence at the end of the *countryatlas and
  ggsql* vignette that broke its markdown structure.
* `.Rbuildignore` now excludes the session-local `.claude/` directory, which
  `git` ignores but `R CMD build` does not, so it was shipping in the tarball
  and tripping `R CMD check`'s "hidden files and directories" NOTE.
* Comments in `R/overrides.R` are ASCII-only, so no source file carries
  non-ASCII characters outside a deliberate `\U` escape.
* `?world_snapshot` no longer splits a code span across two source lines, which
  had left the checked-in `.Rd` disagreeing with what `roxygen2` regenerates.
* `beta_convergence()` failed with a bare `"subscript out of bounds"` when the
  initial levels had no spread across countries. A constant predictor makes
  `lm()` return an `NA` coefficient, which `summary()` then drops entirely, so
  the lookup for it fell off the end. It now says that the initial levels have
  no spread and why that matters.
* The forking path is now tested. `fetch_wdi(parallel = TRUE)` is the default
  for a multi-indicator request, so `wdj_lapply()`'s `mclapply` branch runs on
  one of the package's busiest code paths, yet no test reached it -- every other
  test used a single indicator or passed `parallel = FALSE`. Confirmed: a
  parallel fetch is identical to the serial one, forking preserves order, `...`
  reaches the workers, `wdj_workers()` honours `options(countryatlas.workers)`
  and CRAN's two-core limit, and an error inside a fork is surfaced rather than
  left as a `try-error` for downstream code to trip over.
* The World Bank fetch and assembly path is now tested offline. It needs the
  network, so it had no coverage at all despite holding the least obvious logic
  in the package: `fetch_wdi()`'s multi-indicator reduce-merge (shared keys are
  coalesced rather than suffixed, and values stay aligned per country-year),
  its degradation when one indicator of several fails,
  `country_data(latest = TRUE)`'s "most recent non-NA" collapse (which opens the
  window at 1960 and skips a missing latest year), the panel key, the
  duplicate-key case where two `iso2c` codes map to one `iso3c`, and that
  `cache = TRUE` really short-circuits a repeated fetch. No defects were found;
  the tests pin the behaviour.
* `spin_globe()` validates `n_frames` / `fps` / `width` / `height` / `lat`
  before gating on `gifski` / `magick`, matching how `globe_map()` orders the
  two: a bad argument is the caller's bug and the message should not depend on
  which optional packages happen to be installed.
* `tile_map()` phrased the missing-`iso3c` error differently from the three
  other verbs performing the identical check; all four now read the same.
* Half the examples that were marked `\dontrun{}` now actually run: it covered
  14 of the 55 documented topics and now covers 7. Nine verbs gained executable
  examples -- `locate_country()`, `country_borders()`, `neighbors()`,
  `morans_i()`, `simplify_geometry()`, `bivariate_map()`, `cartogram_map()`,
  `dorling_map()` and the polygon-backend `globe_map()` -- having been
  unrunnable only because their examples made a live World Bank fetch. Driven
  by the bundled `world_snapshot` instead, and guarded with
  `requireNamespace()`, they are `\donttest{}` examples that execute in under
  half a second each. The safe form of `clear_wdi_cache()` is now a live
  example too. `\dontrun{}` remains
  only where the code genuinely cannot run in a check (a network fetch, an HTML
  widget, a written GIF, `ggsql` >= 0.4.1, or deleting files).
* The tests guarding this release's fixes were verified by mutation: each fix
  was reverted in a scratch copy and the suite had to fail. 35 mutations, all
  now detected -- but four were not at first, and each pointed at a real gap:
  * `is.na()` is `TRUE` for `NaN` as well, so the checks on `theil()`'s
    zero-weight result and its shares at perfect equality passed whether the
    value was the fixed `NA` or the `NaN` the bug produced. Both now assert the
    exact value.
  * Nothing verified that quantile breaks are computed on one value per country
    rather than per polygon vertex -- the fix that forced this major version
    bump. Removing the de-duplication, or flipping the flag that controls it on
    either `world_map()` or `globe_map()`'s polygon backend, broke no test.
    There are now checks on the helper, on both call sites, and on the property
    that matters: roughly equal numbers of *countries* per colour.
  * `interactive_map(tooltip = )` was unprotected: the existing tests assert the
    returned object's class, which passes whether the argument is honoured or
    silently dropped -- exactly the pre-2.0.0 bug. Both the `"ggiraph"` and
    `"leaflet"` engines are now checked on the column they are actually handed.
* Degenerate-but-valid input is now covered by tests: perfect equality
  (`gini()` / `theil()` return `0`, not `NaN`), zero-variance columns
  (`NaN` z-scores and `NA` correlations rather than errors), duplicate
  `(iso3c, year)` panel rows, poles and antipodal great circles, collinear
  rings, all-`NA` and all-zero fill columns, and single-country frames.
* `?distance_between` and `?country_meta` now state which countries have no
  bundled centroid. `country_meta` is assembled from `countrycode::codelist`,
  which has no Kosovo row, so `distance_between("Kosovo", "Serbia")` is `NA`
  even though `neighbors("Kosovo")` and `country_borders()` know about it -- and
  ten small or dependent territories have a row but no centroid. The `@return`
  already said `NA` was possible; it did not say which countries, and the
  asymmetry with the geometry backends was surprising.
* The same double-counting affected three more places, all gated on the
  presence of a `group` column -- which polygon frames have and `sf` frames do
  not:
  * `correlate_indicators()` reported `n` and `r` over geometry rows rather than
    countries. That column exists precisely so a correlation computed on a few
    countries cannot masquerade as a world fact, so an inflated `n` defeated the
    point.
  * `audit_coverage()` reported the wrong country count and a wrong `NA` rate
    for every indicator.
  * `bubble_map(backend = "sf")` drew two bubbles for a divided country, where
    the polygon path already guaranteed one per country.
  All three now reduce whenever an `iso3c` column is present.
* Quantile and jenks breaks on the `sf` backend double-counted divided
  countries. The de-duplication added in this release skipped the `sf` path on
  the assumption that Natural Earth is one row per country, but it is not:
  Cyprus occupies two rows sharing one `iso3c` at 110m, as do Cyprus and India
  at 50m. Breaking on the raw column shifted the cut points enough to move real
  countries into the wrong bin -- Saudi Arabia and Libya changed colour in the
  bundled snapshot at `n_bins = 5`. Both backends now de-duplicate on the key,
  so "one value per country" holds exactly rather than nearly.
* `convert_country(x, to = "calling_code")` returned alpha-3 country codes
  instead of telephone calling codes -- `"FRA"` where `33` was meant. The
  shortcut was mapped to `countrycode`'s `genc3c` column, which is an ISO-style
  three-letter code, not a dialling prefix; it now maps to the `telephone`
  column, so France gives `33`, the USA `1` and Japan `81`. A source comment
  claimed the limitation was "documented as best-effort", but `?convert_country`
  never mentioned `calling_code` at all; the shortcut is now listed there.
* The `Description` field -- the text CRAN renders on the package page --
  advertised nine map idioms while the package ships eleven: `spike_map()` and
  `facet_map()` (small multiples) were missing from the vocabulary list, and the
  analysis-helper examples predated this release's inequality and convergence
  statistics. Every idiom it names now corresponds to an exported verb.
* `?countryatlas` listed `morans_i()` under "Core data assembly" while
  `_pkgdown.yml` listed it under "Analysis helpers", so the two navigational
  indexes described the same function as two different kinds of thing. It is a
  spatial statistic, so it now sits with `gini()`, `theil()` and the convergence
  measures on both surfaces.
* The `@seealso` cross-references are reciprocal. All three the package had
  pointed one way only: a reader of `?gini` was sent to `theil()` but a reader
  of `?theil` was sent nowhere, and likewise for
  `beta_convergence()`/`sigma_convergence()` and
  `dissolve_country()`/`check_country_match()`. `?theil` did not link to `gini()`
  at all -- it named Gini in prose without a cross-reference. The four related
  diagnostics (`check_country_match()`, `repair_country_names()`,
  `dissolve_country()`, plus `historical_codes`) now all reference each other.
* Every page taking a `projection` argument now says where the valid values
  are. Only `world_map()` enumerated the 13 projections and only
  `world_geometry()` pointed at it; the other eight entries said no more than
  "Projection." (`bivariate_map()`) or "Projection options for the `sf`
  backend", leaving a reader with nothing to go on. Relatedly, the three pages
  that document `projection` and `recenter` together described only the
  projection, so `recenter`'s meaning -- a central meridian -- was missing from
  `world_data()`, `join_world()` and `attach_geometry()`.
* The `rnaturalearthhires` requirement is now documented on every page that
  takes a `scale` argument, not just `?world_geometry`. Seven topics --
  `world_data()`, `join_world()`, `attach_geometry()`, `locate_country()`,
  `country_borders()`, `neighbors()` and `morans_i()` -- described `scale`
  without mentioning that `"large"` is unobtainable from CRAN, so a reader of
  any of those pages met the gate with no warning.
* `scale = "large"` was offered as a plain option but needs the
  `rnaturalearthhires` package, which is not on CRAN and is not in `Suggests`.
  Left ungated, `rnaturalearth` responded by trying to install it into the
  user's library from a non-CRAN repository and then failing obscurely. It is
  now gated with a message naming the package and the repository to get it
  from, and pointing at `scale = "medium"` (50m) as the option that needs
  nothing extra. `?world_geometry` documents the requirement, and the
  *sf & projections* vignette no longer demonstrates the scale most readers
  cannot run.
* `?country_borders` recommended a graph recipe that produced nonsense.
  `igraph::graph_from_data_frame()` treats the *first two* columns as the edge
  endpoints, and `country_borders()` returns `iso3c_a`, `country_a`, `iso3c_b`,
  `country_b` -- so columns 1 and 2 are both endpoint *A*, and passing the whole
  tibble built edges from each country's code to its own name (56 vertices
  instead of 37 for Europe, every French edge running `FRA` to `"France"`). The
  documented call now passes only the two code columns.
* `?neighbors` and `?country_borders` now warn that `igraph` also exports a
  `neighbors()` -- taking a graph and a vertex rather than country names -- so
  whichever package is attached later wins. `?country_borders` recommends
  `igraph` for turning the adjacency into a graph, which walks users straight
  into the clash, so both pages now say to qualify the call as
  `countryatlas::neighbors()`. It is the only collision between this package's
  exports and any of `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `tibble`, `sf`, `maps`, `WDI`,
  `countrycode`, `scales`, `leaflet`, `plotly`, `igraph`, `raster`, `terra`,
  `purrr`, `stringr`, `forcats`, `readr` or the base packages.
* `?country_overrides` now documents why every name in the override table is
  plain ASCII: ASCII spellings match in any locale, whereas accented spellings
  rely on `countrycode`'s own matching and resolve to `NA` under a non-UTF-8
  locale (`LC_CTYPE=C`). The note points at `iconv(x, to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")`
  for input that may carry accents.
* The test suite is now green under CRAN's `noSuggests` configuration
  (`_R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_=true`), which runs with every optional package
  absent. Four tests called `globe_map(backend = "polygon")` or `morans_i()`
  without guarding on `mapproj` / `sf`, so they errored on the dependency gate
  instead of exercising what they were written to check.
* The quantile/jenks binning that `world_map()` and both `globe_map()` backends
  perform lived as three near-copies kept in step by hand; it is now one
  internal helper. Verified behaviour-preserving by comparing the rendered fill
  of every style x `n_bins` x backend combination before and after (50
  fingerprints, ~2.6M values, all identical).
* Documented `\value` claims are now asserted as executable contracts, so Rd
  prose cannot drift from the code in silence. The 36 exports whose `\value`
  makes a specific structural promise -- named columns, a single row, an
  attached `"model"` object, a length matching the input -- are covered; the
  rest return a `ggplot`, a layer or a widget and are checked by their own
  tests. Every claim audited was already accurate; the tests keep it that way.
* The four exports that had no test call site at all -- `wdi_search()`,
  `clear_wdi_cache()`, `animate_world()` and `cartogram_map()` -- are covered,
  including `cartogram_map(type = "contiguous")` (the default type, previously
  never exercised) and `wdi_search()`'s zero-match and single-match paths.
* The README's "optional features at a glance" table is corrected against what
  the code actually gates on: `spin_globe()` was listed as needing only `maps` +
  `mapproj` when it also hard-requires `gifski` or `magick`; the `ggsql` row
  overstated the requirements of `as_ggsql_source()` (which never needs `ggsql`)
  and understated the version `interactive_map(engine = "ggsql")` needs; and
  `locate_country()`, `flow_map()` and `bubble_map()` were missing.
* The *countryatlas and ggsql* vignette said `DRAW spatial` "was added in 0.4.1"
  as plain fact; it now says that version is newer than what CRAN ships, which
  is why the query-executing chunks are shown but not evaluated.
* The package-level overview (`?countryatlas`) was missing `simplify_geometry()`
  and `clear_wdi_cache()` from its section list, though `_pkgdown.yml` had both.
* The set of ISO codes the package treats as countries was computed in two
  places (name matching and the World Bank aggregate filter); it now comes from
  one internal helper, which region resolution uses as well, so the three
  callers cannot drift apart.
* New offline test suites pin the things a structural test cannot: closed-form
  anchors for the hand-rolled numerical kernels (haversine distance, spherical
  polygon area, great-circle interpolation, Gini/Theil, sigma and beta
  convergence, Moran's I against an independently built weights matrix) and
  internal-consistency checks on every bundled dataset (no duplicate or unknown
  `iso3c`, coordinates in range, one country per `world_tiles` cell,
  `historical_codes` in step with its alias table, and `country_meta`
  centroids still agreeing with `polygon_centroids()`).
* README and vignettes now demonstrate every exported function:
  `wdi_search()`, `country_codes()`, `complete_years()`, `growth_rate()` /
  `index_to()`, `repair_country_names()`, `country_join_all()`,
  `locate_country()` and `facet_map()` gained worked examples, and the
  vignettes prefer `country_overrides()` over the soft-deprecated
  `wdj_overrides()`. The README's rendered output and figures were stale
  (pre-dating the quantile-breaks fix and the `gdp_per_capita_2015` opt-in)
  and have been re-rendered from the 2.0.0 code.
* `geofacet` is dropped from `Suggests`: no code ever used it, and
  `?tile_map` / the README claimed a `geofacet`-backed small-multiples
  feature that did not exist. Facet a `tile_map()` like any other `ggplot`,
  or use `facet_map()` for choropleth small multiples.
* The README's figures are shipped in the tarball again, so the images on the
  CRAN package page resolve. `.Rbuildignore` excluded the generated `.png`s
  but not the (much larger) `.gif`, which left six of the seven images
  broken.
* `?world_snapshot`'s `@format` said "two elements" while listing three, and
  advertised an `sf` element that is `NULL` in the released package. It now
  documents what actually ships and points at `attach_geometry()` for
  geometry.
* `?attach_geometry` documents which countries each geometry backend actually
  carries. Rows with no matching geometry are dropped silently, and the `sf`
  backend's `scale` changes *which* countries exist rather than only how
  detailed they are: of the 215 countries in `world_snapshot`, the default
  `scale = "small"` (110m) maps 169 and `scale = "medium"` maps 214. Five
  territories (Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Macao, Tuvalu, the British Virgin
  Islands) are in no backend at any scale.
* `?world_tiles` and `?tile_map` said "one square per country" without saying
  how many. The grid is the 239 `country_meta` rows that have a bundled
  centroid, so the 10 without one have no tile and `tile_map()` silently drops
  `data` rows keyed on them. Both are now documented, and a test pins the
  grid to that definition.

# countryatlas 1.0.0

A single, comprehensive release that takes the package from a one-function proof
of concept to a complete toolkit for joining world data to maps. The spirit is
unchanged (*ISO codes as the universal join key, one call to a map-ready
table*) but pushed to its full potential.

## Breaking-ish changes

* `world_data()` is generalised but backward-compatible: `world_data(2020)`
  still returns the classic polygon-backed, GDP-per-capita tibble. The only
  visible change is the column name `gdp_per_capita_2015` → `gdp_per_capita`.
  A one-cycle deprecation shim keeps `gdp_per_capita_2015` available as an alias
  (toggle with `options(countryatlas.gdp_compat = FALSE)`).
* The 16 regions the previous version silently dropped (Kosovo, Micronesia, the
  Virgin Islands, Saint Martin, Bonaire/Saba/Sint Eustatius, the Canary Islands,
  Madeira/Azores, …) are now **matched** via [`wdj_overrides()`] instead of
  deleted, so they appear on maps. Diffs of map output will show increased
  coverage.

## New: core data assembly

* `world_data()` gains `indicator` (one or many WDI codes; named vectors drive
  clean column names), multi-year **panels**, an `sf` backend
  (`geometry = "sf"`), `region` subsetting, `latest`, projections and caching.
* `country_data()`: the lightweight, one-row-per-country analysis table.
* `world_geometry()`: projected, region-subset geometry (countries, centroids,
  coastline, borders, graticule, ocean).

## New: the join engine (exposed for *your* data)

* `standardize_country()`, `join_world()`, `attach_geometry()`, `country_join()`.

## New: diagnostics

* `check_country_match()`, `wdj_overrides()`, `audit_coverage()`: never lose a
  country silently.

## New: reference data & translation

* `convert_country()` (flags, currency, tld, research codes), `country_codes()`,
  `country_groups()` / `in_group()`, `wdi_search()`.
* Bundled datasets: `world_snapshot`, `country_meta`, `common_indicators`,
  `country_groups_tbl`, `world_tiles`.

## New: analysis helpers

* `per_capita()`, `aggregate_regions()`, `rank_countries()`, `complete_years()`.

## New: visualization

* `world_map()` (continuous / binned / quantile / jenks / categorical),
  `bubble_map()`, `bivariate_map()`, `cartogram_map()`, `tile_map()`,
  `flow_map()`, `animate_world()`, `interactive_map()`, `geom_country_labels()`,
  `theme_world_map()`.

## Performance & offline

* WDI fetches are memoised with an optional on-disk cache; multiple indicators
  are fetched in parallel (`parallel::mclapply`) where supported.
  See `clear_wdi_cache()`.
* The bundled `world_snapshot` lets every example, test and vignette run offline
  and deterministically.

## Engineering

* Namespace hygiene (targeted `@importFrom` instead of blanket `@import`).
* Input validation with friendly `cli` / `rlang` errors.
* A `testthat` (3e) suite; network calls are skipped offline and on CRAN.
* Algebraic invariants alongside the closed-form anchors. An anchor pins one
  value, which a wrong divisor can still satisfy for a single input; these pin
  the relationships instead -- shares summing to one within each year,
  `per_capita()` multiplying back to the original value, a deflator equal to
  the base year and a PPP factor of one being identities, compounding
  `growth_rate()` walking the series back out, `index_to()` landing exactly on
  `to` at the base year, ranks forming a permutation, and `gini()`/`theil()`
  reaching their analytic bounds and staying scale-free.
* The test run is kept out of the checking account's file space, so
  `R CMD check` cannot report "new files in some other directories" -- the NOTE
  CRAN raised against 1.0.0. The redirect now sets `R_USER_CACHE_DIR` as well
  as `XDG_CACHE_HOME`: `tools::R_user_dir(pkg, "cache")` reads the former
  first, so setting only the fallback left the redirect at the mercy of the
  machine, and wherever `R_USER_CACHE_DIR` happened to be set a suggested
  package's cache still escaped to the real user directory.
* Vignettes and a `pkgdown` site.
* Refreshed CI: R-CMD-check, test-coverage and pkgdown workflows.
* Heavy spatial dependencies (`sf`, `rnaturalearth`, `cartogram`, `biscale`,
  `geofacet`, `gganimate`, `leaflet`, …) are all in `Suggests` and gated by
  `rlang::check_installed()`, so the base install stays light.

Group memberships in `country_groups_tbl` are point-in-time as of 2024-01-01.

# countryatlas 0.1.0

* Initial experimental release with a single `world_data(year)` function.
