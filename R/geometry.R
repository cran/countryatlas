#' Geometry without the data
#'
#' Sometimes you just want the canvas: country polygons, label-ready centroids,
#' coastlines, internal borders, a graticule or an ocean rectangle -- already
#' projected, region-subset and antimeridian-safe. This is the building block
#' the plotting functions sit on, exposed for power users.
#'
#' @param what What to return: `"countries"` (default), `"centroids"`,
#'   `"coastline"`, `"borders"`, `"graticule"` or `"ocean"`.
#' @param geometry `"polygon"` (a tibble of `long`/`lat`/`group`) or `"sf"`.
#' @param scale Natural Earth resolution for the `sf` backend. The polygon
#'   backend serves one bundled resolution and warns if asked for another:
#'   `"small"` (110m), `"medium"` (50m) or `"large"` (10m). `"large"`
#'   additionally needs the `rnaturalearthhires` package, which is not on CRAN
#'   (`install.packages("rnaturalearthhires", repos =`
#'   `"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")`); `"small"` and `"medium"` need
#'   nothing beyond `rnaturalearthdata`. Coarser scales carry fewer
#'   countries as well as less detail -- see [attach_geometry()].
#' @param region Optional subset: a continent, a group name, a vector of `iso3c`
#'   codes, or a bounding box `c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`. A box is the one form
#'   that clips the shapes themselves rather than selecting whole countries --
#'   properly, via `sf::st_crop()`, on the `sf` backend. The polygon backend can
#'   only drop the vertices outside the box, which leaves a country straddling
#'   the edge with an approximate outline, so it warns.
#' @param projection Projection for the `sf` backend (see [world_map()]). The
#'   polygon backend returns unprojected longitude/latitude and warns if asked
#'   to project.
#' @param recenter Optional central meridian (e.g. `150`) for the `sf` backend.
#'   The polygon backend cannot recentre and warns if asked to.
#' @param year Draw the world as it was in this year, via [historical_geometry()]
#'   and CShapes (1886-2019). Returns `sf` keyed on `gwcode`; only
#'   `what = "countries"` is available, and `region` cannot be combined with it.
#'
#' @return A tibble (polygon backend) or `sf` object (sf backend), with columns
#'   depending on `what`:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{`"countries"`}{polygon: `long`, `lat`, `group`, `order`, `region`,
#'       `subregion`, `iso3c`, `iso2c`. sf: `iso3c`, `iso2c`, `name_long`.}
#'     \item{`"centroids"`}{the same identifier columns plus `centroid_lon` and
#'       `centroid_lat`.}
#'     \item{`"coastline"`, `"borders"`, `"ocean"`, `"graticule"`}{sf only.}
#'   }
#'   **The centroid columns are in the coordinate system of the object
#'   returned**, so on the sf backend they are projected metres, not degrees --
#'   `centroid_lon` for France is `174097`, not `2.1`. For centroids in degrees
#'   use [country_meta]`$centroid_lon` / `$centroid_lat`, which is also what the
#'   polygon backend returns.
#'
#'   A few Natural Earth features have no ISO code and so come back with `iso3c`
#'   `NA` -- Somaliland at every scale, plus the Indian Ocean Territories and
#'   Ashmore and Cartier Islands from `"medium"` on. They are kept so the land is
#'   still drawn; drop or [country_overrides()] them if you group by `iso3c`.
#'
#'   `"orthographic"` is the one genuinely hemispheric projection: the countries
#'   on the far side have no image and come back as empty geometries, and the
#'   ones on the horizon are cut there (correctly, but `sf::st_coordinates()`
#'   cannot read a column that mixes empty and non-empty -- drop them first).
#'   The other three azimuthal projections
#'   (`"azimuthal_equal_area"`, `"north_polar"`, `"south_polar"`) are Lambert
#'   equal-area and draw the *whole* globe, the far side stretched around the
#'   rim rather than dropped, so pass `region` if you want a polar view of the
#'   northern countries alone.
#'
#'   `"ocean"` is a whole-globe background rectangle. It is unavailable in all
#'   four azimuthal projections -- `"orthographic"` has no image for it, and the
#'   Lambert three cut the globe at the antipode, which collapses the rectangle's
#'   outline -- and it cannot be recentred; both cases error rather than
#'   returning an invisible layer.

  # mislabelling this function exists to prevent. Differencing modulo 360

  # square, a wrapped square and a polar cap. The bundled polygon data splits
  # pieces at the antimeridian, so no centroid changes today -- all 239 match
  # country_meta either way -- and this is about not depending on that.

  # The limit is inherent, not an oversight: from longitudes already wrapped

  # that encircles the globe, so a formula has to choose. Differencing modulo
  # 360 chooses "short way", which is right for any ring whose edges are
  # shorter than 180 -- true of all real polygon data, and of the densified
  # polar cap above. It reads a *coarse* whole-globe rectangle (four corners,
  # one 360-degree edge) as zero area. No country piece has that shape; the
  # only such ring here is world_outline(), which is sf geometry and never
  # reaches this function.
  # Adjust only the edges that actually wrap. Differencing every edge modulo
  # 2*pi would do the same thing arithmetically, but the round-trip is not
  # exact in floating point, and R^2/2 is ~2e7, so it turned a ring with

#' Attach geometry to a country-level table
#'
#' The bridge between a one-row-per-country table (e.g. from [country_data()])
#' and plotting: bolts polygon or `sf` geometry onto your data, keyed on
#' `iso3c`.
#'
#' @param data A data frame with an `iso3c` (or `by`) column.
#' @param by The join key (default `"iso3c"`).
#' @param geometry `"polygon"` (default) or `"sf"`.
#' @param scale Natural Earth resolution for the `sf` backend. The polygon
#'   backend serves one bundled resolution and warns if asked for another. `"large"` needs the
#'   non-CRAN `rnaturalearthhires` package; see [world_geometry()]. It also
#'   affects which countries are covered at all -- see below.
#' @param region Optional region subset (see [world_geometry()]).
#' @param projection,recenter Projection, and optional central meridian, for
#'   the `sf` backend (see [world_map()] for the projections available). The
#'   polygon backend can do neither and warns if asked.
#' @param overrides Name -> iso3c overrides applied when matching the geometry
#'   backend's country names (default [country_overrides()]). Pass a custom set
#'   built with [country_overrides()] to add your own.
#' @param year Attach historical geometry for this year instead of present-day
#'   borders, via [historical_geometry()]. Entities that never had an ISO code
#'   cannot match on `iso3c`, so a low match rate warns.
#'
#' @section One row in, one row out:
#' Geometry is attached once **per row**, not once per country. That is what a
#' panel wants -- one row per country-year, each carrying the shape -- but it
#' means a frame that repeats a country by accident draws that country more than
#' once, and only the last one painted is visible. The package cannot tell the
#' two apart (a panel's time column may be called anything), so reduce to one row
#' per country yourself when that is what you meant.
#'
#' @section Which countries have geometry:
#' The join keeps only countries the chosen backend actually carries, so rows of
#' `data` with no matching geometry are dropped silently -- worth checking first
#' when a country you expected is missing from the map. Coverage differs by
#' backend and, for `"sf"`, by `scale`, which changes *which* countries are
#' present and not merely how detailed they look. Of the 215 countries in
#' [world_snapshot], `"polygon"` carries 210, `"sf"` with `scale = "small"` (the
#' default, 110m) carries 169, and `"sf"` with `scale = "medium"` carries 214:
#' the 110m coastlines omit most small states, so `scale = "medium"` is the fix
#' when microstates matter -- Hong Kong, Macao, Tuvalu and the British Virgin
#' Islands are each in no other backend. Gibraltar alone is in none of them.
#'
#' @section How many rows come back:
#' The result is the backend's whole map, not just your rows: every country the
#' backend carries is present, and the ones absent from `data` carry `NA` in
#' your columns. That is what makes them draw in `na.value` rather than vanish,
#' which is the point -- a choropleth that quietly omits the countries you have
#' no data for reads as though they did not exist. It does mean the result is
#' much larger than `data` and is not something to summarise directly:
#' `attach_geometry()` on three countries returns 240 of them on the polygon
#' backend and 176 on `"sf"`, whatever `data` held. The row count is larger
#' still: `"polygon"` gives one row per polygon *vertex* (about 99,000), and
#' `"sf"` one row per *feature* -- usually one per country, but a divided
#' country appears more than once (Cyprus at `scale = "small"`; Cyprus and
#' India at `"medium"`), so an `iso3c` join against it can fan out. Summarise
#' `data` before attaching geometry, or use the verbs in this package, which
#' de-duplicate to one row per country first.
#'
#' @return For `"polygon"`, a tibble with `long`/`lat`/`group` plus your
#'   columns, one row per polygon vertex. For `"sf"`, an `sf` object, one row
#'   per feature. Both carry every country the backend has -- see *How many
#'   rows come back*.

#' Country adjacency (shared land borders)
#'
#' Which countries share a land border with which, as a tidy edge list --
#' built from polygon topology ([sf::st_touches()]), so it reflects the same
#' curated geometry as the rest of the package. Powers [neighbors()].
#'
#' @section Turning it into a graph:
#' `igraph::graph_from_data_frame()` takes the *first two* columns as the edge
#' endpoints, so pass only the two code columns -- handing it the whole tibble
#' would build edges from each country's code to its own name:
#' ```
#' igraph::graph_from_data_frame(
#'   country_borders()[, c("iso3c_a", "iso3c_b")], directed = FALSE)
#' ```
#' Attaching `igraph` also masks [neighbors()], which it exports too, so call
#' that one as `countryatlas::neighbors()` from then on.
#'
#' @section Which countries the default leaves out:
#' Adjacency is computed from Natural Earth polygons, and the default
#' `scale = "small"` (110m) has no polygon at all for the European microstates.
#' **Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican are therefore
#' absent from the table entirely** -- not merely missing a short border, but
#' contributing no rows, despite a land border being the whole of their
#' geography. The default reports 310 pairs over 153 countries; France comes
#' back with 8 neighbours rather than 10.
#'
#' `scale = "medium"` (50m) has all five, giving 322 pairs over 162 countries
#' and France its full list. Use it whenever the microstates matter:
#' ```r
#' country_borders(scale = "medium")
#' ```
#' The same 110m gap is why [morans_i()]'s contiguity weights exclude them --
#' see its `n_excluded` -- and it is the land-border twin of the island problem
#' described in `vignette("honest-maps")`. Note the two Guiana borders are real,
#' not artefacts: French Guiana makes Brazil and Suriname neighbours of France.
#'
#' @param scale Natural Earth resolution to compute adjacency from. This is not
#'   a cosmetic choice -- see *Which countries the default leaves out* below.
#'   `"large"` needs the non-CRAN `rnaturalearthhires` package; see
#'   [world_geometry()].
#' @param region Optional region subset (see [world_geometry()]); a pair is
#'   only reported when both countries remain in the subset.
#'
#' @return A tibble, one row per bordering pair: `iso3c_a`, `country_a`,
#'   `iso3c_b`, `country_b`. Each unordered pair appears once, with
#'   `iso3c_a <= iso3c_b` alphabetically.

#' A country's neighbours
#'
#' Which countries border a given country (or countries) -- a vectorised
#' lookup built on [country_borders()].
#'
#' @param x A vector of country names or codes.
#' @param origin How to read `x` (default `"country.name"`).
#' @param scale Natural Earth resolution to compute adjacency from. `"large"` needs the
#'   non-CRAN `rnaturalearthhires` package; see [world_geometry()].
#'
#' @return A tibble with one row per (`iso3c`, `neighbor`) pair: the queried
#'   country's `iso3c`, and each bordering country's `iso3c` and `country`
#'   name (`neighbor`, `neighbor_country`). Countries with no land border
#'   (islands, e.g. Japan, Madagascar) return zero rows.
#'
#' @section Pass a vector, don't loop:
#' Every call rebuilds the whole world's adjacency from polygon topology, so
#' asking about one country costs the same as asking about all of them. `x` is
#' vectorised, and adding countries to a single call only adds the filtering:
#' ```
#' countryatlas::neighbors(c("FRA", "DEU", "ESP"), origin = "iso3c")
#' ```
#' Looping instead pays that rebuild once per country -- for every bordering
#' country in the world, roughly two orders of magnitude more work than one
#' vectorised call. The same applies to [country_borders()], which does the work.
#'
#' @param warn Whether to report values that do not resolve to a country
#'   (default `TRUE`). They match no border, so without this a typo is
#'   indistinguishable from a country that genuinely has no land neighbour.
#'
#' @section Name clash with igraph:
#' `igraph` also exports a `neighbors()`, and it takes a graph and a vertex
#' rather than country names. Whichever package is attached later wins, so if
#' you use both -- which [country_borders()] suggests, for building a graph of
#' the adjacency -- qualify this one as `countryatlas::neighbors()`.
