#' Clear the on-disk / in-memory WDI cache
#'
#' Forget memoised World Bank fetches, both in-session and (optionally) on disk.
#'
#' @section Where the cache lives:
#' The persistent cache goes in the standard per-user cache location,
#' `tools::R_user_dir("countryatlas", "cache")`. Point it elsewhere with
#' `options(countryatlas.cache_dir = )`, or skip the disk entirely by passing
#' `cache = FALSE` to [world_data()] / [country_data()]. The directory itself is
#' created the first time a cached fetch is attempted, whether or not the World
#' Bank answers; only a successful fetch leaves a response in it, and reading the
#' bundled [world_snapshot] never goes near it. Under `R CMD check` the whole
#' cache moves to the session temp directory, so a check never writes to the
#' user's file space.
#'
#' The directory may hold other files too. The cache only ever writes, expires
#' and deletes its own entries (named by a hash, with the extension
#' `.countryatlas`), and `disk = TRUE` removes the directory itself only when
#' that leaves it empty.
#'
#' @section How the cache is managed:
#' The persistent cache expires its own contents, so it does not grow without
#' bound and does not serve stale figures indefinitely: an entry is dropped
#' once it is 30 days old, and if the directory exceeds 50 MB the
#' least-recently-used entries go first. Both limits are adjustable with
#' `options(countryatlas.cache_max_age = )` (seconds) and
#' `options(countryatlas.cache_max_size = )` (bytes). A dropped entry costs a
#' re-fetch, nothing more.
#'
#' Expiry matters beyond disk space: World Bank observations are revised, so a
#' figure cached long ago is not necessarily the figure the API would return
#' today.
#'
#' @param disk Whether to also delete the persistent on-disk cache.
#' @return Invisibly `TRUE`.
#' @export
#' @examples
