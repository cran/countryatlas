#' What a projection preserves
#'
#' Look up the properties of the projections [world_map()] understands: the
#' construction family, whether it is equal-area (a choropleth's ink is
#' proportional to ground area) or conformal (shapes are locally right), and the
#' PROJ string the package builds. Called with no arguments it returns the whole
#' table, which is the quickest way to see what is available.
#'
#' @param projection A projection name, or `NULL` (the default) for every one.
#'
#' @return A tibble with one row per projection: `projection`, `family`,
#'   `property`, `equal_area`, `conformal`, `note` and `proj4`.
#'
#' @section Choosing one:
#' For a world choropleth the honest choice is **equal-area**, because the eye
#' reads coloured area as quantity: a projection that inflates Greenland makes
#' Greenland's value look more important than it is. Equal Earth is the
#' recommended default (and the package's own) -- it is equal-area, close to
#' Robinson in appearance, and cheap to evaluate (Savric, Patterson & Jenny
#' 2019). `"mercator"` is conformal, not equal-area, and should not be used for
#' choropleths. Use [projection_compare()] to see the difference on your own
#' data, and [tissot_map()] to see it on the graticule.

#' Measure what a projection distorts
#'
#' The numeric companion to [tissot_map()]: distortion sampled on a grid, so it
#' can be summarised, compared or mapped rather than eyeballed. Computed by
#' projecting a small circle at each grid point and measuring what happens to
#' it, which is the definition rather than an approximation of it.
#'
#' @param projection Projection to measure (see [projection_info()]).
#' @param measure `"areal"` (default; projected area divided by true ground
#'   area, so 1 is undistorted), `"angular"` (maximum angular deformation in
#'   degrees, 0 for a conformal projection) or `"max_scale"` (the larger
#'   principal scale factor).
#' @param spacing Grid spacing in degrees (default `10`).
#' @param max_lat Absolute latitude limit (default `85`).
#'
#' @return A tibble of `lon`, `lat` and `distortion`, with the area-weighted
#'   mean and the range attached as the `"countryatlas_distortion"` attribute.
#'
#' @section Reading the numbers:
#' An equal-area projection has `"areal"` distortion of 1 everywhere -- that is
#' what equal-area *means*, and it is worth checking rather than trusting.
#' A conformal projection has `"angular"` distortion of 0 everywhere and
#' unbounded areal distortion. A compromise projection is bad at both by a
#' little, everywhere, which is the trade it makes.
#'
#' Distortion is measured against the WGS84 ellipsoid, the datum every CRS the
#' package builds is defined on. Equal Earth, Gall-Peters and the three Lambert
#' azimuthal projections have ellipsoidal forms and read exactly 1. PROJ
#' implements Mollweide and Eckert IV with their spherical formulas, so on this
#' datum they are equal-area only to within about 0.7% (`"areal"` between
