# Flows, networks and relational data ---------------------------------------------
#
# flow_map() draws origin-destination arcs, which is the picture. What was
# missing is everything you do with an OD table *before* you draw it: put it in
# matrix form, describe it as a network, or show it as a grid of small maps
# instead of a plate of spaghetti. Bilateral data is the natural next thing to
# hang off the ISO spine, because reconciling two country columns instead of one
# is exactly twice the problem the package already solves.

#' An origin-destination table as a matrix
#'
#' Reshape a long bilateral table (trade, migration, flights, remittances) into
#' a square origin x destination matrix on the ISO spine, with both country
#' columns standardised. The natural input to a network analysis, and to
#' [country_weights()]`(type = "custom")` -- which is how "countries near each
#' other in trade space" becomes a spatial weights object.
#'
#' @param data An OD table.
#' @param from,to The origin and destination country columns (unquoted).
#' @param weight The flow column (unquoted). If omitted, every pair counts as 1.
#' @param origin How to read `from`/`to` (default `"country.name"`).
#' @param symmetric If `TRUE`, add the transpose so the matrix is undirected
#'   (default `FALSE`).
#' @param fill Value for pairs with no flow (default `0`).
#'
#' @return A square numeric matrix with `iso3c` row and column names. Rows are
#'   origins, columns destinations.
