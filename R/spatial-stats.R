# Spatial weights and the statistics built on them --------------------------------
#
# morans_i() shipped in 2.0.0 with one hard-wired weight scheme: land-border
# contiguity, row-standardised. That is a defensible default and a consequential
# one -- an island has no land border, so Japan, the UK, Australia, Indonesia,
# Madagascar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Iceland and every small island state
# carried no weight and left the analysis. 2.1.0 made that visible (n_excluded);
# this makes it fixable. country_weights("knn") gives every country neighbours,
# and the same object drives local statistics, Geary's C, Getis-Ord and the
# spatial lag.
#
# The distinctive one is type = "custom": adjacency does not have to be
# geographic. "Countries near each other in *trade* space" is often the relevant
# neighbourhood for an economic question, and it goes through the same API.

# `k`, `cutoff_km`, `w` and `scale` each belong to exactly one scheme, and the
# other three ignored them without a word. The costly one is
# country_weights("knn", w = my_matrix): the caller's own adjacency was
# discarded and nearest-neighbour weights returned instead, so the result looks
# entirely reasonable and is not what was asked for. Same treatment the
# projection/recenter/scale notices give an inert argument elsewhere. Each
# argument is compared against its default rather than using missing(), so
# passing a default explicitly stays quiet.

#' Spatial weights on the country spine
#'
#' Build a reusable neighbour-weights object for [morans_i()], [local_morans()],
#' [gearys_c()], [getis_ord()] and [spatial_lag()]. Four schemes, three of which
#' give every country at least one neighbour -- which land-border contiguity, the
#' historical default, cannot do for an island.
#'
#' @param type
#'   * `"contiguity"` -- shared land border, from [country_borders()]. Needs
#'     `sf`. Islands get no neighbours; see [morans_i()]'s note.
#'   * `"knn"` -- the `k` nearest countries by great-circle centroid distance.
#'     Every country gets exactly `k` neighbours, islands included. Needs
#'     nothing but the bundled [country_meta].
#'   * `"distance"` -- every country within `cutoff_km`. Needs nothing.
#'   * `"custom"` -- your own adjacency (see `w`), which is how non-geographic
#'     neighbourhoods -- trade volume, migration flows, colonial or language
#'     ties -- go through the same API.
#' @param countries Optional `iso3c` vector to restrict the weights to. Defaults
#'   to every country the chosen backend knows about.
#' @param k Neighbours per country for `type = "knn"` (default `5`).
#' @param cutoff_km Distance band for `type = "distance"`, in kilometres.
#' @param w For `type = "custom"`: either a square named matrix, or a long data
#'   frame with columns `iso3c`, `neighbor` and optionally `weight`.
#' @param style `"W"` (default) row-standardises so each row sums to 1, the
#'   usual choice for Moran's I; `"B"` leaves the weights binary/raw.
#' @param scale Natural Earth resolution for `type = "contiguity"`.
#'
#' @return A `countryatlas_weights` object: the weights matrix plus the scheme
#'   that built it. Inspect it by printing; `as.matrix()` gives the matrix.
#'
#' @section Choosing a scheme:
#' Contiguity encodes "shares a border", which is the right relation for
#' spillovers that cross borders by land. It is the wrong relation for a global
#' question, because it silently deletes the islands. `"knn"` is the safe
#' default for world-scale work: every country participates, and `k` controls how
#' local the neighbourhood is. `"distance"` is right when the process has a real
#' length scale. `"custom"` is right when geography is not the relevant space at
#' all.

#' Local Moran's I (LISA)
#'
#' Local Indicators of Spatial Association (Anselin 1995): one Moran statistic
#' per country, plus the cluster type it belongs to. Where [morans_i()] answers
#' "is there clustering anywhere", this answers "where, and of what kind".
#'
#' @param data A country-level frame with `iso3c` and the value column.
#' @param value The value column (unquoted).
#' @param weights A [country_weights()] object. Defaults to land-border
#'   contiguity, which excludes islands -- prefer `country_weights("knn")` for
#'   global work.
#' @param n_perm Permutations for the pseudo-p-value (default `999`; use `0` to
#'   skip the test, which leaves `p_value` as `NA`).
#' @param alpha Significance threshold for the `cluster` label (default `0.05`).
#'
#' @return A tibble, one row per country: `iso3c`, `value`, `lag` (the
#'   neighbour average), `ii` (the local statistic), `p_value` and `cluster`
#'   (`"High-High"`, `"Low-Low"`, `"High-Low"`, `"Low-High"` or `"Not
#'   significant"`).
#'
#'   `p_value` is a **two-sided** pseudo-p from conditional permutation:
#'   \eqn{(1 + \#\{|I_i^{*}| \ge |I_i|\}) / (n_{perm} + 1)}, so it is never
#'   exactly zero and its floor is \eqn{1/(n_{perm}+1)} -- with the default 999
#'   permutations, 0.001. Two-sided because a local statistic is interesting at
#'   both ends: a country surrounded by unlike neighbours is as much a finding
#'   as one surrounded by like ones. `cluster` is `"Not significant"` wherever
#'   `p_value > alpha`, and everywhere when `n_perm = 0` leaves it `NA`. Set a
#'   seed beforehand for a reproducible `p_value`.

#' Geary's C (spatial autocorrelation)

  # Unlike the other statistics here, this one hands back a column aligned to
  # the caller's own rows -- so on a panel the mismatch is invisible. Matching
  # on iso3c alone gave every year the *earliest* year's neighbour average:
  # France's value ran 39,683 -> 158,734 -> 277,784 while its lag sat at
  # 63,409 for all three, and dividing one by the other silently compared 2002
  # with 2000. A lag per year is both the correct answer and the one the
  # column's placement already implies.
  # Countries the weights exclude -- no neighbour at this scale -- come back
  # NA, and that NA was indistinguishable from a country whose own value was
  # missing: nothing in the result said which countries the weights had
  # dropped. morans_i() and gearys_c() answer this by *returning* `excluded`,
  # and that is the right vehicle here too rather than a warning: on real
  # geography some country always lacks a land neighbour, so a warning would
  # fire on every ordinary call -- noise instead of signal, and a test pins
  # the silence. An attribute is what this package already uses for a
  # diagnostic side-channel (see "countryatlas_cartogram" and

#' Global Moran's I (spatial autocorrelation)
#'
#' Do neighbouring countries have similar values? Global Moran's I on the country
#' spine, with a permutation pseudo-p-value. No `spdep` required: at ~200
#' countries the dense arithmetic is trivial.
#'
#' @param data A country-level data frame with `iso3c` (map-ready frames are
#'   reduced to one row per country first).
#' @param value The value column (unquoted).
#' @param scale Natural Earth resolution for the default contiguity adjacency
#'   (see [country_borders()]). Ignored when `weights` is supplied.
#' @param n_perm Number of permutations for the pseudo-p-value (default `999`;
#'   use `0` to skip the test, which leaves `p_value` as `NA`).
#' @param weights A [country_weights()] object. Defaults to land-border
#'   contiguity, row-standardised -- which excludes every island. See below.
#'
#' @return A one-row tibble: `i` (observed Moran's I), `expected`
#'   (\eqn{-1/(n-1)} under no autocorrelation), `n` (countries used),
#'   `n_excluded` (countries with data that the weights could not reach),
#'   `n_links`, `p_value` (one-sided, \eqn{P(I_{perm} \ge I_{obs})}, computed as
#'   \eqn{(1 + \#\{I^{*} \ge I_{obs}\}) / (n_{perm} + 1)}, so never exactly
#'   zero -- the floor is \eqn{1/(n_{perm}+1)}) and an `excluded` list-column of
#'   the excluded `iso3c` codes. Set a seed beforehand for a reproducible
#'   `p_value`.
#'
#' @section Which countries are left out:
#' The default weights are land-border contiguity, and an island has no land
#' border -- so any country with no land neighbour *present in `data`* drops out
#' entirely. On the bundled [world_snapshot] that is around a quarter of the
#' countries with data: Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia,
#' Madagascar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Iceland, Cuba, Sri Lanka and every
#' small island state. The omission is systematic rather than random.
#'
#' `n_excluded` and `excluded` report it, and [country_weights()] fixes it --
#' `"knn"` and `"distance"` give every country neighbours:
#' ```r
#' morans_i(snap, gdp_per_capita, weights = country_weights("knn", k = 5))
#' ```
