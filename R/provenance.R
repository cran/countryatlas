# Provenance ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# A countryatlas map is the end of an analysis and the start of a question:
# which vintage, which geometry, which projection, which classification, how
# many countries? Every one of those is known at plot time and none of it used
# to travel with the output. world_map() now records them on the object; this is
# the reader.

#' What went into this map
#'
#' Report the provenance of a [world_map()] (or any plot the package's map verbs
#' produced): the package version, the geometry backend and projection, the
#' classification method and its breaks, the fill column, and how many countries
#' are shown versus missing. These are the questions a reviewer asks first, and
#' the answers are already known at plot time -- this just makes them readable.
#'
#' @param x A plot returned by any of the package's map verbs -- [world_map()]
#'   (either engine), [bubble_map()], [spike_map()], [tile_map()],
#'   [flow_map()], [od_map()], [globe_map()], [bivariate_map()],
#'   [cartogram_map()], [dorling_map()], [gridded_cartogram()],
#'   [value_by_alpha_map()], [coverage_map()], [classify_compare()],
#'   [facet_map()], [lisa_map()], [subnational_map()] or
#'   [projection_compare()] -- or a map-ready data frame, for which the
#'   data-side facts are reported and the drawing-side ones are `NA`.
#'
#'   [tissot_map()] is the one map verb that carries no provenance: it draws
#'   distortion ellipses for a projection and takes no data of yours.
#' @param value For a data frame, the column whose coverage to report
#'   (unquoted). Ignored for a plot, which already knows its own fill.
#'
#' @return A one-row tibble of provenance fields, invisibly printed in a
#'   human-readable block. Fields: `countryatlas`, `fill`, `backend`,
#'   `projection`, `style`, `n_bins`, `na_style`, `n_countries`, `n_missing`,
#'   `n_total`, `uncertainty`, `disputes`, `dispute_policy`, `n_imputed`,
#'   `breaks`, `missing_iso3c` and `snapshot_year`.
#'
#'   The three counts are: `n_countries`, the countries actually drawn with a
#'   value; `n_missing`, those drawn without one; and `n_total`, the two added
#'   together -- every country the map covers. `n_countries` is the numerator,
#'   not the denominator, which its name does not say on its own.
#'
#' @section Putting it on the plot:
#' [world_map()]`(footnote = "auto")` prints the coverage line as a caption, and
#' `classification_report = TRUE` attaches the per-class counts. Together they
#' cover what a methods note needs:
#' ```r
#' p <- world_map(mapdf, gdp_per_capita, style = "quantile",
#'                footnote = "auto", classification_report = TRUE)
#' map_provenance(p)
#' attr(p, "countryatlas_classification")
#' ```

# Restate a derived map's provenance in the caller's terms.
#
# coverage_map(), classify_compare(), lisa_map() and od_map() all draw through
# world_map() with an *internal* column as the fill -- `.wdj_available`,
# `.wdj_class`, `.wdj_cluster`, `.wdj_flow` -- so the provenance world_map()
# writes describes that column and not the one the caller named.
# `.wdj_available` is the sharp case: it is an ifelse() over a logical test with
# both outcomes declared as factor levels, so it is *never* NA, and
# na_coverage() therefore recorded `n_missing = 0` and `n_shown = n_total` for
# every input -- flatly contradicting coverage_map()'s own caption, which is
# computed honestly from the caller's column. Two coverage claims on one object,
# in the verb whose whole purpose is honest missingness. Restate the fill name
# and recompute the coverage against the column the caller actually asked about.
#
# `shown` is for the verb whose drawn column is sparser than the caller's:
# lisa_map() colours only the countries the weights connect, so an island with
# a value is drawn as no-data. Recounting on the value alone put 189 countries
# in map_provenance() under a caption, computed from what was drawn, that said
# 142 -- the same two-claims contradiction, the other way round.
