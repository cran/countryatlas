# Time: historical geometry, existence spans and time-aware auditing -------------
#
# 2.0.0 solved the *code* half of history: historical_codes + dissolve_country()
# resolve "USSR" to fifteen successors, and check_country_match() catches
# countrycode silently mapping it to Russia alone. What was missing is the
# *geometry and membership* half -- a 1970 map still drew 2024 borders. This
# module closes that.
#
# The awkward truth this has to confront: the ISO 3166 spine does not reach
# back. ISO 3166 was published in 1974, and colonies never had codes at all, so
# a pre-1970 map cannot be keyed on iso3c. CShapes is keyed on
# Gleditsch-Ward codes, which countrycode already converts, so historical work
# gets a second spine and says so rather than silently matching a fraction of
# the world.

#' A country's existence span, predecessors and successors
#'
#' When did this country exist, and what came before and after it? Reads the
#' bundled [historical_codes] crosswalk in both directions -- so it answers both
#' "what did the USSR become" and "what was Estonia part of".
#'
#' @param x Country names or codes, current or historical (`"USSR"`,
#'   `"Yugoslavia"`, `"Estonia"`, `"DEU"`).
#' @param origin How to read `x` (default `"country.name"`).
#' @param warn Whether to report inputs that match neither a historical entity
#'   nor a modern country (default `TRUE`), as [dissolve_country()] does.
#'
#' @return A tibble, one row per input: `input`, `iso3c`, `country`,
#'   `dissolved` (the year it ceased to exist, or `NA` if it still does),
#'   `predecessors` and `successors` (list-columns of `iso3c` codes). An input
#'   that resolves to neither spine keeps its `input` and gets `NA` elsewhere;
#'   with `warn = TRUE` it is reported rather than left to be spotted.
#'
#' @section Why the two directions are not mirror images:
#' Both columns hold codes, so an entity ISO never coded cannot appear in
#' either. ISO 3166-3 only records changes from 1974 on, and three entities in
#' [historical_codes] predate it: the United Arab Republic (1961), Tanganyika
#' and Zanzibar (both 1964). Asking about one of those by name works --
#' `country_timeline("Tanganyika")` gives `TZA` as a successor, because the
#' table stores that side as a name -- but the reverse does not:
#' `country_timeline("TZA")` reports no predecessors, since there is no code to
#' report. The other eleven entities carry codes and round-trip in both
#' directions. Naming them instead of coding them would break the column's
#' type; inventing codes for them would be a guess, which this package does
#' not make.

#' Historical country boundaries
#'
#' Country polygons as they were, from CShapes 2.0 (Schvitz et al. 2022), which
#' maps states *and* colonies and dependencies for 1886-2019 with per-polygon
#' validity periods. A 1970 map with 2024 borders is a common and quiet error;
#' this is the fix.
#'
#' @param year The year to draw, or a `Date` for a specific day. CShapes covers
#'   1886-2019.
#' @param dependencies Include colonies and dependencies (default `FALSE`,
#'   matching `cshapes`). For any pre-decolonisation map you almost certainly
#'   want `TRUE` -- most of Africa and Asia is otherwise absent.
#' @param projection Projection to return the geometry in (see [world_map()]),
#'   or `NULL` for unprojected lon/lat.
#'
#' @return An `sf` frame with `gwcode`, `country`, `iso3c` (where one can be
#'   assigned -- see below), `status`, `from`, `to` and geometry. Two further
#'   CShapes columns are passed through when the installed version supplies
#'   them, since they answer the questions this verb is usually asked:
#'   * `owner` -- the `gwcode` of the sovereign a dependency belonged to; a
#'     sovereign state carries its own `gwcode` here. This is the column that
#'     makes `dependencies = TRUE` legible: without it a colony and its
#'     metropole are two unrelated rows. `owner != gwcode` picks out the
#'     dependencies.
#'   * `capname` -- the capital's name at that date.
#'
#'   Both were returned but undocumented. Neither is guaranteed: `cshapes`
#'   decides what its own table holds, so check with `names()` rather than
#'   assuming.
#'
#' @section The ISO spine does not reach back:
#' ISO 3166 was first published in 1974 and never covered colonies, so a
#' historical map cannot be keyed on `iso3c`. CShapes uses **Gleditsch-Ward**
#' codes, which is why `gwcode` is the key here and `iso3c` is a best-effort
#' extra, read off the GW code: the modern code of the state that holds it.
#' So it is `NA` for an entity with no modern counterpart (the German
#' Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the two Yemens), and also
#' where [historical_codes] says the modern state did not exist yet -- GW give
#' the USSR and Russia one code, but the 1980 polygon is the Soviet Union, so
#' it carries `NA` rather than `"RUS"`. A colony carries the code of the state
#' it became: CShapes names the 1950 Gold Coast "Ghana" and it comes back as
#' `"GHA"`, with `status` saying it was a colony. Join historical data on
#' `gwcode`, not on `iso3c`, and use [convert_country()]`(to = "gwn")` to get
#' there from a modern code.
