#' One-line choropleth, several honest styles
#'
#' Encapsulates the choropleth boilerplate and goes beyond a single style.
#' Auto-detects the polygon vs `sf` backend, applies [theme_world_map()], and --
#' for `sf` -- a real projection via [ggplot2::coord_sf()]. Binned / quantile /
#' jenks styles are offered because a continuous fill on a skewed indicator
#' hides almost all the variation; binning is the honest default for
#' choropleths.
#'
#' @param data A map-ready frame from [world_data()] / [join_world()] (polygon
#'   tibble or `sf`).
#' @param fill The fill column (unquoted).
#' @param style `"continuous"` (default), `"binned"`, `"quantile"`, `"jenks"`
#'   or `"categorical"`.
#' @param projection For the `sf` backend, any of the projections in
#'   [world_geometry()]: `"equal_earth"` (default), `"robinson"`, `"mollweide"`,
#'   `"natural_earth"`, `"plate_carree"`, `"mercator"`, `"winkel_tripel"`,
#'   `"eckert4"`, `"gall_peters"`, `"orthographic"`, `"azimuthal_equal_area"`,
#'   `"north_polar"` or `"south_polar"`.
#' @param palette Optional palette name passed to the relevant `ggplot2` scale.
#' @param n_bins Number of bins for binned/quantile/jenks styles.
#' @param borders Draw country borders (default `TRUE`).
#' @param title,legend Optional plot title and legend title.
#' @param na_label Legend key label for missing data, used by the styles with
#'   a discrete legend (`"quantile"`, `"jenks"`, `"categorical"`); the
#'   continuous and binned colourbars have no `NA` key to name. Honoured by
#'   both engines. A length-1 `NA` leaves the engine's own formatter alone.
#' @param recenter Optional central meridian for the `sf` backend.
#' @param na_style How to draw countries with no data: `"grey"` (default),
#'   `"hatched"` (diagonal hatching via the optional `ggpattern`, unmistakable
#'   and greyscale-safe; grey, with a message, when `ggpattern` or the `sf` it
#'   draws with cannot be loaded), `"outline"` (white fill, keeping only the
#'   border) or `"omit"` (do not draw them at all). See the section below.
#' @param footnote Optional caption. `"auto"` generates a coverage line
#'   ("174 of 195 countries shown; 21 missing"), so the map cannot quietly
#'   overstate what it covers. A string is used verbatim; `NULL` (default) adds
#'   nothing.
#' @param uncertainty Optional uncertainty column (unquoted) -- a standard
#'   error, a confidence half-width, anything where larger means less certain.
#'   Supplying it switches the fill to a **value-suppressing uncertainty
#'   palette** (Correll, Moritz & Heer 2018): the value range contracts as
#'   uncertainty rises, so an uncertain estimate cannot claim an extreme colour,
#'   and the legend becomes the value x uncertainty grid.
#' @param n_uncertainty Number of uncertainty levels for the VSUP (default `3`).
#' @param engine `"ggplot2"` (default) or `"tmap"`. The package is
#'   ggplot2-native; the `tmap` path is an alternative renderer for people
#'   already working in tmap, and needs an `sf` frame. It honours `style`,
#'   `n_bins`, `palette`, `title` and `legend`, and ignores the ggplot2-specific
#'   arguments.
#' @param disputes `"ignore"` (default) or `"mark"`, which outlines the
#'   [disputed_territories] present in the data and notes the convention in the
#'   caption. See [dispute_policy()].
#' @param classification_report If `TRUE`, attach the breaks, the method and
#'   the count of countries per class to the returned plot as the
#'   `"countryatlas_classification"` attribute, and print them with
#'   [map_provenance()]. A map whose top class holds one country and whose
#'   bottom holds ninety is misleading, and the counts say so immediately.
#'   `style = "continuous"` draws a colourbar and so has no classes to report:
#'   there the attribute is `NULL` and a warning says why.
#'
#' @return A `ggplot` object.
#'
#' @section Missing data is not zero:
#' The default grey reads as "low" to many people, which is exactly wrong for
#' "unknown". `na_style = "hatched"` draws diagonal hatching instead --
#' unambiguous, and it survives greyscale printing. `"omit"` leaves a hole,
#' which is honest but can be mistaken for ocean. Whichever you pick,
#' `footnote = "auto"` states the count in words:
#' ```r
#' world_map(mapdf, gdp_per_capita, na_style = "hatched", footnote = "auto")
#' ```
#' [coverage_map()] goes further and maps availability itself.
#'
#' @section Choosing a classification:
#' The classification changes what readers conclude, and not by a little.
#' Brewer & Pickle's 56-subject study over nine map series found **quantiles**
#' among the best methods for general choropleth reading, and natural breaks
#' (Jenks) below 70% as accurate -- the opposite of the common GIS default.
#' `style = "quantile"` is therefore the safe choice for a general audience.
#' Jenks earns its place on strongly clustered distributions, where quantiles
#' would split a natural group across two colours. Use [classify_compare()] to
#' see the difference on your own data before committing.

#' Area-honest cartogram
#'
#' Resizes countries by `weight` (population, GDP, ...) via the optional
#' `cartogram` package, defeating the "big empty countries dominate the eye"
#' bias of world choropleths.
#'
#' @section Which algorithm:
#' `"contiguous"` (Dougenik) and `"dorling"`/`"noncontiguous"` come from
#' `cartogram`. `"flow"` comes from `cartogramR` and implements the
#' Gastner-Seguy-More flow-based method, which is both the current state of the
#' art and far faster than diffusion-based approaches -- prefer it for
#' contiguous cartograms when `cartogramR` is available.
#'
#' Cartograms fail quietly: an under-converged one looks plausible while still
#' misrepresenting the areas it exists to make honest. Pass a larger `itermax`
#' if the result still looks close to the true map.

#' Centroid-anchored country labels
#'
#' A `ggplot2` layer that places labels (names, ISO codes or flag emoji) at
#' country centroids, with optional `ggrepel` collision avoidance. Designed for
#' the polygon backend produced by [world_data()] / [join_world()]: it reads the
#' `long`, `lat` and `group` columns, so it errors on an `sf` frame and points at
#' [ggplot2::geom_sf_text()] instead. Placement is exact only while `group` is
#' present -- that is what identifies each country's separate pieces, and the
#' label goes on the largest one.
#'
#' @param mapping Aesthetic mapping; defaults to `aes(label = iso3c)`.
#' @param data Optional layer data, as for any `ggplot2` geom: a frame (label
#'   only those countries -- the usual way to label a handful rather than all
#'   two hundred), or a function of the plot's data. Whatever you pass is
#'   reduced to one centroid per country before it is drawn. Defaults to the
#'   plot's own data.
#' @param repel Use `ggrepel` to avoid overlaps (default `TRUE`). Falls back to
#'   plain labels, with a one-time note, when `ggrepel` is not installed.
#' @param flag If `TRUE`, label with flag emoji instead of the mapped label.
#' @param size Label text size.
#' @param ... Passed to the underlying text geom.
#'

#' One square per N people
#'
#' A gridded (or "waffle") cartogram: the world redrawn as equal cells, each
#' worth a fixed quantity, allocated to countries in proportion to their value
#' and placed near where they belong. Where a Dorling cartogram preserves
#' position and a contiguous one preserves adjacency, this preserves
#' *countability* -- the reader can literally count the cells.
#'
#' @param data A country-level or map-ready frame with `iso3c`.
#' @param value The column to allocate cells by (unquoted).
#' @param cells Total number of cells to distribute (default `1000`). Each cell
#'   is then worth `sum(value) / cells`.
#' @param fill Optional fill column (unquoted); defaults to `value`.
#' @param cell_size Grid spacing in degrees (default `2.5`).
#'
#' @return A `ggplot` object. The per-country cell allocation is attached as the
#'   `"countryatlas_cells"` attribute -- every placeable country, including the
#'   ones that rounded to zero cells, so `share` sums to 1 and the rounding is
#'   fully visible.
#'
#' @section Rounding is the whole difficulty:
#' Allocating a whole number of cells to each country cannot be exact, so the
#' remainder has to go somewhere. This uses the largest-remainder method, which
#' guarantees the cell total is exactly `cells` and that no country with a
#' positive value gets zero cells while a smaller one gets one. The attached
#' table reports each country's exact share alongside its integer allocation so
#' the rounding is inspectable rather than hidden.
#'
#' @section Crowded neighbours overlap:
#' Each country's block is centred on its own centroid, with no collision
#' avoidance between countries. That is deliberate -- a global packing solve
#' would push countries away from where they belong -- but it means blocks in
#' crowded regions are drawn on top of one another, and a partly hidden block
#' cannot be counted or compared. The effect is not marginal: at the defaults
#' (`cells = 1000`, `cell_size = 2.5`) about a third of the cells overlap a
#' cell of a different country, across some sixty countries, and it grows with
#' `cells` -- at `cells = 2500` it is roughly two thirds.
#'
#' `cell_size` is the lever, because it scales the tiles without moving the
#' centroids: dropping it to `1.5` cuts the overlap at `cells = 1000` to about
#' a tenth of the cells. Fewer `cells` also helps. Where exact areas matter
#' more than geographic position, [dorling_map()] resolves collisions by
#' displacing circles instead.

#' the residual error per country, so the failure is visible.
#'
#' @param x A `ggplot` from [cartogram_map()] or [dorling_map()], or the `sf`
#'   frame the cartogram was computed from.
#' @param weight The weight column (unquoted). Required when `x` is a plain `sf`
#'   frame; read from the plot otherwise.
#'
#' @return A tibble of `iso3c`, `target_share` (the country's share of the
#'   weight), `actual_share` (its share of the cartogram's area) and
#'   `area_error` (the relative difference). The summary -- mean absolute error,
#'   worst country -- is attached as the `"countryatlas_cartogram"` attribute.
#'
#' @section What counts as converged:
#' A perfect cartogram has `area_error` of 0 everywhere. In practice a mean
#' absolute error under a few percent is good and under 10% is usually
#' acceptable; a systematically large error, or one concentrated in the small
#' countries, means the algorithm stopped early. Raise `itermax` and try again.
