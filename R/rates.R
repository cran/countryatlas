# Rates, denominators, deflation and convergence clubs ---------------------------
#
# per_capita() is where users hit the small-number problem: a rate computed over
# eleven thousand people gets exactly as much ink on a choropleth as one computed
# over a billion. value_by_alpha_map() and the cartograms are the *visual*
# answers; rate_check() and smooth_rates() are the statistical ones, and this is
# where they live alongside the deflation helpers that make a money series
# comparable across years at all.

#' Flag rates computed over tiny denominators
#'
#' The small-number problem, named: a rate over a very small population is mostly
#' noise, and on a map it shouts as loudly as a rate over a very large one. This
#' reports which countries' rates you should not trust before you plot them.
#'
#' @param data A country-level frame.
#' @param numerator,denominator The count and the population it is over
#'   (unquoted).
#' @param min_denominator Denominators below this are flagged. `NULL` (default)
#'   uses the 10th percentile of the observed denominators, which adapts to the
#'   data rather than imposing a threshold that suits one indicator.
#' @param rate An existing rate column (unquoted), if you already computed it.
#'   Otherwise the rate is `numerator / denominator`.
#'
#' @return A tibble of `iso3c`, `numerator`, `denominator`, `rate`,
#'   `expected_se` (the Poisson standard error of the rate, \eqn{\sqrt{r/d}};
#'   `NA`, with a warning, for a negative rate) and `flagged`, sorted with the
#'   least reliable first.
#'
#'   "Least reliable" is ordered on the standard error a *single* event would
#'   imply, \eqn{\sqrt{\max(y, 1)}/d}, which is identical to `expected_se` for
#'   every row with at least one event. Ordering on `expected_se` directly put
#'   zero-count rows last, at the reliable end: it is \eqn{\sqrt{y}/d}, which
#'   is exactly `0` when the count is `0`, so one country with no events out of
#'   251 people outranked another with one event out of the same 251. Observing
#'   nothing is not evidence of precision. `expected_se` itself is still the
#'   plain Poisson standard error, `0` and all.
#'
#'   `flagged` is `TRUE` for a
#'   denominator below the threshold, `FALSE` above it or missing, and `NA` for
#'   every row when no threshold could be computed at all -- which is warned
#'   about, and means `sum(flagged)` is `NA` rather than a misleading `0`.
#'
#' @section What to do about it:
#' Three answers, in rough order of preference: [smooth_rates()] shrinks the
#' unreliable rates toward the global rate; [value_by_alpha_map()] leaves them
#' alone but fades them out; or drop them and say so in the caption. Plotting
#' them raw and unremarked is the one option that misleads.

#' Shrink unreliable rates toward the global rate
#'
#' Empirical-Bayes smoothing: a rate computed over a small denominator is pulled
#' toward the overall rate in proportion to how little information stands behind
#' it, while a rate over a large denominator is left essentially alone. Standard
#' practice in disease mapping, and the statistical counterpart to
#' [value_by_alpha_map()]'s visual answer.
#'
#' @param data A country-level frame.
#' @param numerator,denominator The count and its denominator (unquoted).
#' @param method `"eb"` (default) for empirical-Bayes shrinkage, or `"none"` to
#'   compute the raw rate only.
#' @param suffix Suffix for the new columns (default `"_smoothed"`).
#'
#' @return `data` with `<numerator>_rate` and `<numerator>_smoothed` columns
#'   added, plus `<numerator>_shrinkage` -- the weight given to the country's own
#'   rate, between 0 (fully shrunk to the global rate) and 1 (untouched). A row
#'   with no finite, positive denominator or with a negative count has no rate:
#'   all three are `NA` there, with a warning.
#'
#' @section The model:
#' A Poisson-gamma model: counts \eqn{y_i \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(d_i \theta_i)}
#' with \eqn{\theta_i \sim \mathrm{Gamma}}, whose mean and variance are estimated
#' from the data by the method of moments. The posterior mean is
#' \eqn{w_i r_i + (1 - w_i)\bar{r}} with \eqn{w_i = d_i / (d_i + \alpha)}, so the
#' shrinkage weight is exactly the "how much do we believe this country"
#' quantity that `rate_check()` flags. Where the between-country variance is
#' estimated as non-positive (rates no more dispersed than Poisson noise alone),
#' every rate shrinks fully to the global mean, which is the right answer:
#' the data contain no evidence of real between-country variation.
#'
#' On a panel the prior is estimated separately for each `year`, so every
#' rate is shrunk toward its own year's global rate and every row is kept.

#' Convergence clubs
#'
#' Countries do not all converge to one steady state; they converge in groups.
#' This implements the Phillips-Sul (2007) log-t procedure: a regression test for
#' whether a set of countries is converging, applied iteratively to peel off
#' clubs that converge internally even when the whole sample does not.
#'
#' @param data A panel with `iso3c`, `year` and the value column.
#' @param value The value column (unquoted); usually income per head.
#' @param min_size Smallest club to report (default `2`). Countries left over
#'   are returned as club `NA`.
#' @param alpha Significance level for the one-sided log-t test (default
#'   `0.05`; the critical value is \eqn{-1.65}).
#'
#' @return A tibble: `iso3c`, `club` (an integer, 1 = highest-level club, `NA` =
#'   not classified), and the club's `log_t` statistic. The per-club test results
#'   are attached as the `"countryatlas_clubs"` attribute. Every country in
#'   `data` appears: one without a complete series (a missing or non-finite
#'   value in any year) cannot be tested, so it comes back with `club = NA` and
#'   a warning naming it.
#'
#' @section The test:
#' For each country form the relative transition path
#' \eqn{h_{it} = y_{it} / \bar{y}_t}, then regress
#' \eqn{\log(H_1/H_t) - 2\log(\log t)} on \eqn{\log t} over the last part of the
#' sample, where \eqn{H_t} is the cross-sectional mean of
#' \eqn{(h_{it}-1)^2}. The one-sided *t* statistic on \eqn{\log t} is the log-t
#' statistic: above \eqn{-1.65} the group is converging. Clubs are then formed by
#' sorting countries on their final-period value and growing a core group while
#' the test still passes.
#'
#' A panel needs a reasonable number of periods for this to mean anything --
#' below roughly fifteen the test has very little power, and the function warns.
