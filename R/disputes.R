# Disputed territories, uncertainty and imputation --------------------------------
#
# Every world map takes a political position, including the ones that think they
# do not. Natural Earth documents an explicit de facto policy; the EU's
# data-visualisation guidance counts roughly 188 disputed areas and notes that
# official publications must reflect an official position.
#
# This package's position is that it has none, and that pretending otherwise is
# the failure mode. So: [disputed_territories] records *that* a dispute exists
# and *who the parties are*, [dispute_policy()] lets the user state which
# convention they are using, and nothing here adjudicates. What the package can
# usefully do is stop a disputed area passing unremarked.

#' State which map convention you are using
#'
#' Disputed territories are drawn differently by different conventions, and a
#' map that does not say which one it used is making a choice silently. This
#' sets the session's convention so [world_map()] can record it and
#' [map_provenance()] can report it.
#'
#' @param policy One of:
#'   * `"none"` (default) -- no convention stated. Maps carry no dispute
#'     annotation, exactly as before.
#'   * `"de_facto"` -- boundaries as administered on the ground, which is what
#'     Natural Earth (and therefore this package's geometry) uses.
#'   * `"de_jure"` -- boundaries as claimed. The package does **not** ship de
#'     jure geometry; selecting this records the intent and warns that the
#'     shapes drawn are still de facto.
#'   * `"neutral"` -- disputed areas marked as disputed rather than assigned.
#'
#'   Called with no argument, returns the current policy.
#'
#' @return When called with no argument, the policy currently in effect. When
#'   setting, the policy that was in effect *before* the call, invisibly -- R's
#'   convention for a setter, so
#'   `on.exit(dispute_policy(dispute_policy("neutral")))` restores it.
#'
#' @section What this does and does not do:
#' It records a choice and makes it visible. It does not redraw any boundary,
#' and selecting `"de_jure"` will not give you claimed-boundary geometry,
#' because the package does not have any -- Natural Earth's auxiliary claim
#' lines are not bundled. Anyone publishing under an institutional convention
#' should verify the shapes against that institution's own basemap rather than
#' trusting a setting.

# --- Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes -------------------------------------
#
# Correll, Moritz & Heer (CHI 2018): a 2-D palette where the *value* range
# contracts as uncertainty rises, so an uncertain estimate cannot claim an
# extreme colour. Their crowdsourced study found readers weighted uncertainty
# more heavily with a VSUP than with an ordinary bivariate map. The construction
# here is the continuous form: a country's position along the value ramp is
# pulled toward the middle in proportion to its uncertainty, and the legend is
# laid out as the value x uncertainty grid the palette actually is.

# Build the per-row fill colour and the matching legend levels.
# One resolution of the value-suppressing ramp, for the map and its legend both.
#
# vsup_fill() resolved it with a tryCatch fallback to viridis while vsup_scale()
# hard-coded viridis, so the two could disagree about what the swatches mean.
# hcl.colors() also takes a *different* set of names from
# scale_fill_viridis_c(): it accepts "plasma", "inferno", "cividis", "mako" and
# "rocket" but rejects "magma" and "turbo", which the rest of world_map()
# honours. Falling back in silence would reproduce the bug this replaced --
