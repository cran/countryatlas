# Curated overrides -------------------------------------------------------------

#' Curated country-name overrides (replaces the silent drop-list)
#'
#' A documented `custom_match` table for entities that map backends
#' ([ggplot2::map_data()] and Natural Earth) get wrong or leave without an ISO
#' code. Earlier versions of the package *deleted* these regions; now they are
#' *matched* instead, so they stop silently disappearing from maps.
#'
#' The table maps a country/region name (as spelled by the geometry backends) to
#' an ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code. Pass the result as the `custom_match` argument to
#' [standardize_country()], [world_data()] and friends. Every downstream code
#' (`iso2c`, continent, region, flag, ...) is derived from this `iso3c`, so a
#' single override is enough.
#'
#' @param extra An optional named character vector of additional overrides
#'   (names are country/region names, values are `iso3c` codes). Merged on top
#'   of the built-in table, so you can extend or override it, e.g.
#'   `country_overrides(c(Somaliland = "SOM"))`.
#'
#' @section Accented names and locales:
#' Every name in this table is plain ASCII, and that is deliberate: ASCII
#' spellings match in any locale. Accented spellings (`"Curacao"` with a
#' cedilla, `"Saint Barthelemy"` with an acute) are matched natively by
#' [countrycode::countrycode()] *in a UTF-8 locale*, which is why they are not
#' listed here -- but in a non-UTF-8 locale (`LC_CTYPE=C`) they cannot be
#' compared reliably and resolve to `NA`.
#'
#' Accented spellings also come in two Unicode forms that look identical: the
#' accent can be one precomposed code point (NFC) or a base letter followed by
#' a combining mark (NFD, which macOS returns for filenames). Only NFC matches
#' [countrycode::countrycode()]'s tables, so a name that resolves to nothing is
#' retried with its combining marks stripped, which turns an NFD spelling into the
#' ASCII spelling that resolves anywhere. Only unresolved names are retried, so
#' this never changes a name that already matched.
#'
#' If your input may contain accented country names, run in a UTF-8 locale.
#' De-accenting with `iconv(x, to = "ASCII//TRANSLIT")` gives ASCII spellings
#' that resolve everywhere, but it is not an escape from the locale problem:
#' `//TRANSLIT` is itself locale-dependent, so under `LC_CTYPE=C` it returns
#' `NA` (or, given an explicit `from = "UTF-8"`, replaces each accent with `?`)
#' and nothing resolves. De-accent while still in a UTF-8 locale, or supply the
#' ASCII spellings directly.
#'
#' @return A named character vector suitable for `countrycode(custom_match=)`.
