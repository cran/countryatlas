# Data sources beyond the World Bank ---------------------------------------------
#
# The ISO spine is source-agnostic by design, but until now only WDI was wired.
# The fix is a contract, not N bespoke fetchers: register_country_source() lets
# any provider -- including the several that are not on CRAN, and any internal or
# proprietary feed -- become a first-class source without the package depending
# on it. Four built-in adapters ship for discoverability.
#
# The differentiating verb is compare_sources(). Anyone can call owidR. What
# nobody does is tell you that OWID and the World Bank disagree about GDP per
# capita for fourteen countries because of different vintages, PPP bases or
# territorial definitions. On the ISO spine that comparison is one join, and it
# is exactly the class of quiet error this package exists to prevent.

# The registry. An environment rather than a list so registration from a user's
# .Rprofile or another package persists for the session.
the_sources <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())

#' Register a data source on the country spine
#'
#' Teach `countryatlas` where to get indicators from. A source is a name plus a
#' `fetch` function; once registered it works with [fetch_indicator()],
#' [add_indicator()] and [compare_sources()] exactly like the built-in ones.
#'
#' This is deliberately a registry rather than more `Suggests`. It means a
#' provider with no CRAN package -- V-Dem, the IMF, the World Inequality
#' Database -- is reachable without this package depending on anything, and it
#' means an internal or proprietary feed is a first-class citizen.
#'
#' @param name Short source name, used everywhere else (e.g. `"wdi"`).
#' @param fetch A function `(indicator, countries, years)` returning a tidy data
#'   frame. See the contract below.
#' @param meta Optional one-line description of the provider.
#' @param citation Optional citation string; surfaced by [country_sources()] so
#'   users can credit the data.
#' @param key_col The country-key column `fetch` returns (default `"iso3c"`).
#'   A column *name*, not a coding scheme.
#' @param key_type How to read that column: any [countrycode::countrycode()]
#'   origin scheme (default `"iso3c"`). Set it to `"country.name"` for a source
#'   keyed on country names.
#' @param cache Whether results should be memoised for the session
#'   (default `TRUE`).
#'
#' @return Invisibly, the source name.
#'
#' @section The fetch contract:
#' `fetch(indicator, countries, years)` must return a data frame with:
#' * a country key column (named `key_col`, holding `key_type` values --
#'   normally an `iso3c` column of `iso3c` codes),
#' * a `year` column (integer) *if* the data is a panel,
#' * one column per requested indicator, named after the indicator, and
#' * one row per key -- `iso3c` for a cross-section, `iso3c` and `year` for a
#'   panel.
#'
#' The key has to be unique because [add_indicator()] joins on it: a repeated
#' key multiplies the caller's rows, so it is reported rather than joined in
#' silence. Aggregate before returning if the provider serves several rows per
#' country-year.
#'
#' `countries` is a character vector of `iso3c` codes or `NULL` for all;
#' `years` is a numeric vector or `NULL` for the provider's default. Returning
#' extra columns is fine -- they travel through. Anything the provider cannot
#' serve should come back as `NA`, not as a missing row, wherever that is
#' cheap to arrange.

#'
#' @section How much `countries` actually saves:
#' `countries` bounds the *result*, not necessarily the download. Only some
#' providers accept a country filter in the request:
#'
#' | Source | `countries` reaches the provider? |
#' |---|---|
#' | `comtrade` | yes -- sent as `reporter` |
#' | `wdi` | partly -- the year range is sent, countries are filtered here |
#' | `owid`, `eurostat`, `oecd` | no -- the full dataset is downloaded, then filtered |
#'
#' So `add_indicator(one_row, "owid", "life-expectancy")` still transfers every
#' country and year that dataset holds in order to keep a single value. When
#' that matters, narrow with `years` (which the `wdi` and `comtrade` adapters do
#' push down), or fetch once into a variable and reuse it rather than calling
#' this per subset. The on-disk cache means a repeated `wdi` fetch is free;

#' `Suggests`-gated on that provider's own client package -- `countryatlas` does
#' not reimplement any of them. All four are registered as sources, so the usual
#' route is [fetch_indicator()]`("owid", ...)` rather than calling these
#' directly; they are exported because calling them directly is sometimes what
#' you want.
#'
#' @param indicator Indicator code(s), optionally named to rename the output
#'   columns.
#' @param countries Optional `iso3c` vector.
#' @param years Optional numeric year vector.
#' @param ... Passed to the underlying client.
#'
#' @return A tibble on the ISO spine: `iso3c`, `year` and one column per
#'   indicator.
#'
#' @section Which provider needs what:
#' | Adapter | Needs | Notes |
#' | --- | --- | --- |
#' | `fetch_owid()` | `owidR` | Our World in Data; `indicator` is an OWID chart slug |
#' | `fetch_eurostat()` | `eurostat` | European coverage only; geo codes are harmonised to `iso3c` |
#' | `fetch_oecd()` | `OECD` | `indicator` is a dataset id; OECD's own filters go through `...` |
