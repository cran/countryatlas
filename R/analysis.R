#'
#' @param data A panel with `iso3c` and `year`.

#' Theil index, with between/within decomposition
#'
#' The Theil T inequality index -- less famous than Gini, but it decomposes
#' *exactly* into a between-group and a within-group component, answering "how
#' much of world inequality is between continents vs within them?" in one
#' call. Weight by population to describe inequality between people rather
#' than between country units.
#'
#' @param x A positive numeric vector (log scale; zero/negative values are
#'   dropped with a warning).
#' @param weights Optional non-negative weights (e.g. population), either the
#'   same length as `x` or length 1.
#' @param groups Optional grouping vector (e.g. continent), the same length as
#'   `x` (or length 1). When supplied, the decomposition is returned instead of
#'   the scalar. A row whose group is missing is dropped along with the rows
#'   whose value is missing, so the decomposition's `total` is computed over the
#'   grouped subset and can differ from the ungrouped `theil(x)`. For
#'   `world_snapshot`, Puerto Rico has no `region`, which is the whole of the
#'   difference there.
#' @param na.rm Whether to drop `NA` values (default `TRUE`).
#'
#' @return Without `groups`: a single non-negative number (`0` = perfect
#'   equality). With `groups`: a tibble with components `"total"`,
#'   `"between"` and `"within"` (`total = between + within`) and each
#'   component's `share` of the total (`NA` when the total is `0`, i.e.
#'   perfect equality, and the shares are undefined).
#'
#'   When there is nothing to compute (no values left after `na.rm`, a zero
#'   total weight, an infinity in `x` or `weights`, or, with `na.rm = FALSE`, a
#'   missing value or group), the result is a single `NA` whatever `groups`
#'   says, so reach for the components only after checking `is.data.frame()`.
