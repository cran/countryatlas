# Subnational geography ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The package's whole design rests on one key, iso3c, and one row per country.
# Going below that is the largest scope change in the roadmap, so it is done
# narrowly and on the same principles: a documented key (ISO 3166-2, or NUTS in
# Europe), reconciliation as the value added, geometry delegated to somebody
# else's package, and nothing bundled.
#
# What this is NOT: a general GIS layer. There is no admin2, no bundled
# boundary data, and no attempt to harmonise administrative levels across
# countries -- a French departement and a US state are not the same kind of
# object and pretending otherwise would be the same category error the package
# exists to prevent at country level.

#' Standardise subnational region names to ISO 3166-2
#'
#' The subnational counterpart to [standardize_country()]: resolve messy region
#' names within a country to ISO 3166-2 codes, so subnational data can be joined
#' on a real key instead of on spelling.
#'
#' @param data A data frame with a region column.
#' @param region The region-name column (unquoted).
#' @param country The country column (unquoted), or a single country name/code
#'   applying to every row. ISO 3166-2 codes are only unique *within* a country,
#'   so this is required.
#' @param origin How to read `country` (default `"country.name"`).
#' @param warn Warn about regions that do not resolve (default `TRUE`).
#'
#' @return `data` with `iso3c` and `iso_3166_2` columns added. Unresolved
#'   regions get `NA`, never a guess.
#'
#' @section Coverage, stated plainly:
#' Two things resolve, and it is worth being blunt about how little that is.
#'
#' A `region` value that is *already* an ISO 3166-2 code (`"DE-BY"`, `"US-CA"`)
#' passes through, upper-cased and trimmed, provided its country prefix
#' matches the country the row gives -- these codes are unique only within a
#' country, which is why `country` is required. A mismatch is reported and
#' left as `NA`.
#'
#' A region *name* resolves only through the optional `regions` package's
#' crosswalk, and only when the installed version exposes a name-to-code pair
#' this function recognises. As of `regions` 0.1.8 none of them do:
#' `nuts_lau_2019` offers `lau_name_national` / `lau_name_latin` and
#' `all_valid_nuts_codes` has no name column, so **no region name resolves at
#' all**, anywhere -- the function says so once per session. The package
#' carries no ISO 3166-2 name table of its own, deliberately: the datasets that
#' do pair names with codes key on NUTS codes (`DE2`) rather than ISO 3166-2
#' (`DE-BY`), and filling `iso_3166_2` from those would put a different code
#' system in the column.
#'
#' So: pass codes if you have them. If you have names, expect `NA` until
#' `regions` ships a usable crosswalk. This function returns `NA` rather than a
#' plausible-looking wrong code, and [audit_coverage()] on the result is the
#' right next step.
