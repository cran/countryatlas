# gini() computed the weighted mean absolute difference with outer(), i.e. an

# 99,338 rows, needing ~79 GB, and the R process was killed outright -- no error,
# no message. It now uses the sorted cumulative form, O(n log n) time and O(n)
# memory, which agrees with the pairwise version to floating-point noise.

# Provenance for the figures below: cross-checked against independent
# implementations, not just derived by hand. gini() agrees with
# DescTools::Gini(unbiased = FALSE) to 1.7e-16 over 200 random trials, weighted
# and unweighted -- which matters because the weighted kernel was rewritten from
# the O(n^2) pairwise form. haversine_km() agrees with
# geosphere::distHaversine(r = 6371.0088) to 1.5e-15 relative over 500 random
# pairs. Neither package is a dependency, so those comparisons are not run here.
